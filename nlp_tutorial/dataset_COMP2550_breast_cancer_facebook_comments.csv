"I also had Breast Cancer and had a mastectomy and was out of work for a while recovering and then worked about 5 or 6 hours a day instead of 10. Although I worked at my job since 1973, my bosses were very understanding. I did have to use whatever sick days I had and 3 weeks of vacation, that was my only concern. At that time 2005,it hurt us financially so I can understand her situation. You do not need any more stress but you should fight it. Good luck Survivor."

"I would be dead now if I hadn't had a mamogram"
"I had only cancer cells...no lump...never would have caught it before it was too late without the mammogram...I am for them!"
"Rediculous to say mammos have nothing to do with catching cancer...thats like saying the xray had nothing to do with finding a fracture lol"
"Foolish, mine was caught at annual mammogram would be in big trouble without having it.."
"My mammogram saved my life!!!!!"
"Mine was caught at an early stage by my yearly mammogram when I was 49. Lumpectomy and radiation were my treatment. I'm a firm believer in mammograms."
"I has to beg for a mammogram , my obgyn for 3 years told me not to worry . It was cystic breast disease and I needed to quit drinking coffee . Three years later when he brushed me off again I went to another doctor. , stage three in three quadrants and had spread . My persistence saved my life but earlier detections would have given me more choices . Women , know your body and don't be afraid to demand answers ."
"My cancer was found at age 40 on my very first baseline mammogram.  Less than a month later I had a mastectomy. My Oncologist told me that had I waited another 6 months the prognosis could have been grim.  8 years later I am fine.  Nuff said!"
"Ridiculous!  Sounds like insurance is trying to rule the roost again. In trying to pay less they are risking our lives."
"I agree, mammogram caught my in one breast, i found in second so that mammo was very helpful.can't always believe .take it from these ladies that know.thank god all are well."
"Found mine. My doctors and I could not feel the tumors. I would be out of here if I had not gone for my mammogram."
"Seriously??? Not true!  Get those mammos ladies!!!!!!!"
"I am really thankful for the mammogram testing.  It has picked up my cancer and being under 40, if I didn't get it done and waited, well who knows!!! "
"Saved me"
"I'm alive because of screening and early detection. "
"Saved Me so false"
"Me too...though mine was DCIS with no outward signs by the time I had lumps it may have been much worse"
"I found mine then had a mammogram for confirmation .... but the mammo didn't pick it up (a 2 cm lump); even though the doctor knew it was there. I personally feel that self examination AND mammograms are the best way to go.  Doing both is sure to pick it up.   If I'd relied only on the mammo it wouldn't have been found until too late."
"I never felt  a lump but the mamogram picked  it up"
"i never felt my lump but my mammogram showed otherwise. Within 3wks I've been thru the mammogram, ultrasounds, biopsys, bone scan, blood work, mri's and surgery. Iam grateful that I had my mammogram at age 40. I do not agree with the ""Mammograms have no impact on breast cancer"" nor do I agree with insurance companies wanting to wait until women are 50 to get their mammograms."
"Had mammogram was negative but it was wrong , MY cancer did come back only way I found out was thru a biopsy !!! God bless xoxo"
"At age 46 ,very first mammogram ever they found something did ultrasound biopsy was early stage invasive lobular, had lumpectomy, radiation ,on tamaxofin they are saying i only have fifteen percent chance it comes back, go for my six month mammo wed i have my fingers crossed, wish me luck!"

"It's pitiful that the charity can't be trusted to use the money for research"
"There's so much hype and awareness about breast cancer, BUT so little about other cancers, like mine - Pancreatic Cancer????"
"I think it's pathetic that organizations devoted to raising money for cancer research are paying enormous salaries to their top executives.  Komen was founded by a breast cancer victim's sister.  Is she so jaded that she's forgotten why she started this in the first place? Her sister would be ashamed of her.  This was never supposed to be a money making proposition for her but on over $600,000 a year she is well above the middle class standard of living!"
"Nope don't wear one unless i absolutely need too"
"Yes. I get annoyed. When I was diagnosed almost no one gave me practical help even though I live on my own with a (then) 8 year old son, yet people give to these sorts of charities and feel they're helping.  What I really needed was help from more friends and neighbours"
"Worse and Biggest Fraud and Scam in US is Breast Cancer follow by other Cancers.

Breast cancer charity and donation failed to produce any treatment or finding of cure. Only the founder and few staff got rich. 
Breast cancer was also a man made mistake. In the 1950s and on, X Ray were being shoot directly to the front of women' chest. Knowing this have harmful to the body, they no longer do this. Avoid x ray and ultra sound as much as possible,  it's bad for you and your fetus and been know to cause cancer. Again breast cancer is common yet they hide it from the public. Because x ray still being use.

"Had a look through this Facebook page and I don't see anything about prevention. If you want a cure donating to cancer research program is a waste of money. Cancer is the most profitable disease in the world and theres no money in the cure. There's money in treatment. The cure comes with prevention and educating yourself about what's in your water, food, air and vaccines. Once you change your diet, detoxify your body, eat organic, supplement with vitamins, minerals and other things that our body needs our bodies will have a strong immune system to fight cancer off naturally. I know  a lot of you drink bottled water or other drinks which have BPA in the plastic which is an estrogen mimicker. Too much estrogen causes hormonal problems and breast cancer. Vaccines have aluminum, adjuvants, squalene, mercury and other additives that suppress the immune system and can be a catalyst for cancer to spread. GMO veg and fruits are modified to produce there own pesticide and cause sterilization and cancer tumors in all the rats. GMO corn helps feed cancer, helps it grow and spread in your body and everything has corn syrup made with GMO corn. Come on people get off your asses and make a change in your life. Research these things yourself and get healthy. Fight to get these chemicals, pesticides and other cancer causing agents out of our food and water. Only then will you see cancer rates fall. Only you can prevent it by getting educated. I can say this because my mon passed from stage 4 lung cancer. I did a crap load of research after she passed and I wish she never had gotten chemo. Chemo is the worst thing you can do to your body. Kills your immune system and when you get it the second time your body can't fight it off. Chemo side effect is cancer. Everyone has a natural form of cancer in there body and there is things like immune suppression, and other catalysts that can cause it to get out of hand where your body can no longer fight it off. Hope this helps some of you."

"Some doctors really suck! When I was 19 I lost my 27 year old sister To cervical cancer Because her doctor In Phoenix Arizona For two years in a row did her pap smear and the results on both pap smears show positive cancer and she was never told or notified. she then changed doctors and finds out she had cervical cancer for those two years! So for those two years cancer spread throughout her body and she died less than a year later at MD Anderson in Houston. Early detection is so powerful and curable! May God be with everyone that's affected by it!"

Chemo is the worst thing you can do to your body. Kills your immune system and when you get it the second time your body can't fight it off. Chemo side effect is cancer. Everyone has a natural form of cancer in there body and there is things like immune suppression, and other catalysts that can cause it to get out of hand where your body can no longer fight it off. Hope this helps some of you."
"Lee, I want to know if you have ever had cancer....  You saw your mother go through it.  I appreciate the research that you have done. I as a stage 4 breast cancer survivor agree with most of what you have said.  But I believe that each one of us that have some type of cancer have and are still trying to change our way of life.  This site was made to help the people that are sick to know that they are not alone.  The way your post was written I find very offensive!  I'm speaking only for myself, you can kiss the ass you think I'm just sitting on.  Have you changed your life since your mom got sick.  I sure hope so. I would also like to say I'm sorry for your mom, I'm sure she fought as hard as she could!  God bless you and your family."
"Talk! Please talk!! God Bless this family!"
"This is so sad. We as a society have made it taboo. In some peoples eyes if you talk about personal issues you are doing something wrong, or abusing or molesting your child or someone else's child. I'm sorry but as a parent I would rather my child come to me even it may make for an uncomfortable discussion. And busy bodies need to stay out of what is no concern to them. 
I'm sorry for these parent and families loss."
"Too sad!! open up talk to your parents! don't hide nothing about your body from them, no matter what it is!!! talk!!!!!"
"This poor boy and his family... how heartbreaking!  I am so grateful that I always felt (and still do, even as a grown woman) that my parents were people I could easily talk to about anything.  If they didn't have an answer or didn't know what to suggest, by God, we were going to sit down and figure this thing out!  Sure, there were things I wasn't keen to discuss with my parents, but I knew that, if I brought any topic to them, they would be honest with me and would help me to the best of their abilities.  Praying for this family... :'("

"This is so sad, go reason to be less shy about our bodies around our kids. I hope this family can make it through this tragedy."

"Had a look through this Facebook page and I don't see anything about prevention. If you want a cure donating to cancer research program is a waste of money. Cancer is the most profitable disease in the world and theres no money in the cure. There's money in treatment. The cure comes with prevention and educating yourself about what's in your water, food, air and vaccines. Once you change your diet, detoxify your body, eat organic, supplement with vitamins, minerals and other things that our body needs our bodies will have a strong immune system to fight cancer off naturally. I know  a lot of you drink bottled water or other drinks which have BPA in the plastic which is an estrogen mimicker. Too much estrogen causes hormonal problems and breast cancer. Vaccines have aluminum, adjuvants, squalene, mercury and other additives that suppress the immune system and can be a catalyst for cancer to spread. GMO veg and fruits are modified to produce there own pesticide and cause sterilization and cancer tumors in all the rats. GMO corn helps feed cancer, helps it grow and spread in your body and everything has corn syrup made with GMO corn. Come on people get off your asses and make a change in your life. Research these things yourself and get healthy. Fight to get these chemicals, pesticides and other cancer causing agents out of our food and water. Only then will you see cancer rates fall.

"How do you prevent cancer Lee when there are so many things that can cause it - even things within our own bodies? How do you prevent hormone receptive cancer?  Hormones are produced by our bodies and not everyone is lucky enough to know they're at risk.  You can't always control what's in your water, food, etc.  What research have done that's been published that can prove what you're saying?  Education doesn't always prevent what you can't control."
"Two time breast cancer warrior been thru hell because I looked healthy dumb ass doctor kept saying the lump on my chest was nothing & said breast cancer could NEVER come back to breast that had prior mastectomy !!!!!! Went did biopsy was positive another breast removal & they FEAR me into 65 days of RAdation that has now caused me to have scars on lungs , enlarged heart , horrible side effects !!!!!!!!!! Now on RICK SIMPSON HEMP OIL & will NEVER EVER DO CHEMO & NEVER TRUST CANCER CASH COWS PLEASE DONT GIVE $$$$$$ UNLESS YOU SEE CANCER WARRIOR YOURSELF !!!!! PRAYING I LIVE LONG ENOUGH SEE IT WATCH DR SANJAY GUPTA SPECIAL ON YOUTUBE CALLED ""WEED"" ISRAEL BEEN USING IT FOREVER WITH GREAT RESULTS GOD BLESS !"
"That's is terrible , I went threw Breast Cancer and that is nothing to be faking , they should be put in jail for faking because I wouldn't put Cancer on anybody and me and my Husband had cancer at the same time and now I'm a widow , it just isn't right !!!!!!"
"Cannot feel one iota of sympathy for her. She knew exactly what she was doing. Cold and calculated."
"She is a fool , I don't understand why anyone would want to do this to there family or friends!! Karma is a bitch !! I lost my mother to breast cancer and she went through the surgery to remove her breast them had chemotherapy and radiation her cancer spread throughout her body even went to her brain in the end !!! She needs help yes but mentally!!!"

"I fought breast cancer. Surgeries, chemotherapy, hormone therapy...and am still here.  I lost a few friends to cancer.  I don't wish cancer on anyone.  This woman is all messed up or greedy.  That is unforgivable."
"As a breast cancer survivor who was a single mom at the time of a 9, 10 and 15 year old I am appalled . Anyone who has walked this journey would never wish it on anyone . I am still healthy 12 years later after surgeries , chemo and radiation . Just finished paying off the bill 2 years ago . It has affected every aspect of my life . Amazingly enough I would not trade it because my life was blessed with the people who helped me through this . 
You however have some serious soul searching to do not only to the hurt you cause your friends and family but your children ! My son still fears me getting sick again . Shame on you and yes I do think this is fraud and should be a penalty . You have already paid a price .... More than you can likely understand ."

"Yes they do. The UV Lamps are the same type of light used in suntan beds. The UV (ultra violet) light penetrates the skin and may cause cancer. I've noticed that some salons are applying sunscreen just prior to putting the clients hands in the unit. This is not safe as sunscreen must be applied about 15 minutes before exposure."

"spread cancer? its not contagouis"
"Cancer will spread if the tools use for this procedure touch other organs in the abdominal cavity.  If you have uterine cancer."

"I usually do the walk for hope up in Duarte, at City of Hope. This yr it's sup to be nov. 2 I think!"

"Wowww"
"They are not interested in a cure.."
"that sounds crazy but makes me glad i do not go for these kind of visits"
"Please read the article!  The photograph is 100% misleading.  None of the instruments (not tools) pictured are the problem.  They are talking about one specific instrument used in only one type of surgical procedure (done in an operating room, not in any doctor's office) and only one fairly rare type of uterine cancer.  I'm an RN who worked in surgery and for GYN oncology specialists."

Even if men can have breast cancer but it seem only women do. How can cancer or disease be sexist? It's seem that only women being target on purpose in the scam of all things that they do.

More than 1.3 millions US women had been falsely diagnose with breast cancer, only small % have life' threaten breast cancer but, media and associate had them scared and scam billions $$$$ of US citizen and government in form of advertisement, race marathon, donation, charity and grants.

Can we stopped ALS charity scam before it become the most profiting charity  scam like Breast Cancer Associations?

Breast Cancer is Sexist

In early 2012, the Susan G. Komen Foundation announced that it would be rescinding funding to Planned Parenthood; funding that had been used to provide breast cancer screenings to women with low-incomes. The group<U+2019>s claim that the decision to remove funding from Planned Parenthood was not based on the political views of Komen leadership was met with skepticism by many. Karen Handel, then senior vice president for public policy for Komen, ran on an anti-Planned Parenthood platform in her failed bid for governor of Georgia in 2010, adding fuel to the controversy.

Founder and CEO of the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Nancy Brinker, received a 64% raise in 2012, bringing along with it a salary of $684,000 a year.

<U+201C>This pay package is way outside the norm,<U+201D> said Ken Berger, CEO of Charity Navigator, an organization that evaluates charities. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s about a quarter of a million dollars more than what we see for charities of this size. <U+2026> This is more than the head of the Red Cross is making for an organization that is one-tenth the size of the Red Cross.<U+201D>

Cause Marketing

Cause marketing is when a for-profit organization teams with a non-profit charitable organization, often consisting of promotions that promise that a set percentage of proceeds on select items will go to the non-profit organization. Examples of this in the world of breast cancer include Yoplait<U+2019>s <U+201C>Save Lids to Save Lives<U+201D> campaign (Komen), the NFL<U+2019>s <U+201C>Crucial Catch<U+201D> campaign (American Cancer Society), and Kentucky Fried Chicken<U+2019>s <U+201C>Buckets for the Cure<U+201D> campaign (Komen).

like and share my page, thank you

https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1469725903290050

The goal of cause marketing is for a brand to benefit from positive public relations coverage as well as gaining the opportunity to win greater market share through cross-promotion and planting the idea in consumers<U+2019> minds that if they<U+2019>re already planning on spending money in a vertical, it might as well be with the business tied to the noble charity.

Komen<U+2019>s partnership with KFC reeked of cause dissonance. The supposed goal of this promotion was to <U+201C>save lives,<U+201D> but in reality, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in American women. One 8 piece bucket of KFC extra crispy chicken contains 2,380 calories and 160 grams of fat. Even if you split that bucket among 4 people, you<U+2019>re still looking at 595 calories (60% calories from fat) and 40 grams of fat. Additionally, the launch of the <U+201C>Buckets for the Cure<U+201D> campaign coincided with the launch of KFC<U+2019>s double-down sandwich, featuring pieces of fried chicken as the <U+201C>bread<U+201D> of the sandwich. You<U+2019>re either trying to save our lives or you<U+2019>re trying to kill us. Pick one, KFC.

Similarly, the NFL<U+2019>s <U+201C>Catch for a Cure<U+201D> campaign would be classified as cause marketing. If you turned on any of the NFL games this past weekend, you probably noticed that the fields had basically turned into a sea of pink. Players wore pink gloves, refs through pink flags, fans wore pink jerseys, and players ran towards pink first down lines. In the name of raising awareness, the NFL is doing its best to capitalize on an underrepresented demographic: women. In 2012, the NFL<U+2019>s contributions to the American Cancer Society as a result of the <U+201C>Catch for a Cure<U+201D> campaign, came in at $1.5 million. This represents 0.0188% of the NFL<U+2019>s operating revenue.

The Sexualization of Breast Cancer

Why exactly does breast cancer, above other forms of cancer, find itself the centerpiece of the cancer research/marketing field? For lack of a better way to phrase this: breasts are sexy.

<U+201C>Save the boobies!<U+201D> <U+201C>Save the ta-tas!<U+201D> <U+201C>Save Second Base!<U+201D> <U+201C>Feel Your Boobies!<U+201D>

These are all examples of actual lines organizations have used to promote breast cancer awareness. The American Cancer Society takes the cake with its own tag line: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s Okay to Look at Our Chests!<U+201D>

The sexualization of this all-too-real medical condition plays right into the classic marketing strategy of <U+201C>sex sells.<U+201D> Maybe so, but that doesn<U+2019>t make it right; and it certainly doesn<U+2019>t make it any less objectifying.

These slogans work to divide the woman, the human life at risk, from her breasts. When you say, <U+201C>save second base,<U+201D> you<U+2019>re not only playing into the idea that the value of a woman lies solely in her looks, but you<U+2019>re also suggesting that we should search for a cure for nothing else but to give men something to play with.

Breast cancer is serious, not sexy.

You don<U+2019>t see this type of marketing approach for other types of cancer. You wouldn<U+2019>t see a <U+201C>save the nuts!<U+201D> poster for testicular cancer awareness, would you? Why is it any more appropriate to say, <U+201C>save the boobies?<U+201D>

Conclusion

Do the ends justify the means? Is your hard earned money going towards the cause, or is it simply making its way to the pockets of NFL owners, yogurt conglomerates, auto dealerships and charity executives like Nancy Brinker<U+2019>s paycheck?

Breast cancer is a very real medical condition that will lead to the deaths of nearly 40,000 people this year, alone. If you<U+2019>re going to donate to this cause, I hope you do your research, find out how much of your money will be going towards research, screenings and treatment.

"A routine mammogram is exactly how a very good friend Georgina's breast cancer was found, I beg to differ this articles content :("
"I found a lump mammogram and ultrasound confirmed fine. DCIS found on other side. I am too young for routine mammograms so in 3 years I might not of been here. As mine had turned to cancer and travelled to my lymph nodes. 3 lots of surgery,chemo and radiotherapy. I am very lucky. Mammogram saved my life!!"
"Mammograms don't catch all masses when you have dense breast.... doctors don't have to disclose this to you... This can increase your risk by 6 x .  I believe in consistently checking yourself & learn your body.  Find out family history.   Best of luck to all..."
"Mine was detected through a mammo...early detection..."
"I routine mammogram found my breast cancer at stage zero so the path is so much easier than it would have been if I had not had one and waited for a larger lump to develop! Get one every year!!!"
"You HAVE to have an ultrasound too, mine wasnt found thru mammogram  GET the ultrasound too."
"A mammogram saved my life.."

"There are different types of breastfeeding cancer. Some are only seen and some are only felt. Some are more aggressive than others. You need to have a yearly mammogram AND do monthly self breast exams. Be responsible for yourself! I  am a mammographer. I see breast cancers caught everyday in the early stages by getting yearly mammograms. There are exceptions to every case. Once again be responsible to yourself. Follow the American Cancer Society guidlines."
"I go every yr for my mammogram & they do the ultra sound I don't have cancer. I do it for myself,My mother,my aunt & grandmother that who have /had cancer."
"I've been having Mammograms done since the age of 37, but for the past four years I've had them done twice and this year I had it done three times since the beginning of the year....now they say that I might have a cancer in the nipple on my right breast. I have a cyst in the right breast for many years now and Thank God it hasn't worsen but I've been having a discharge lately with an odor....no blood and not everyday but about three or four times a week. I'm a little scared and nervous I even forgot the name she said for the type of cancer it might be but first I will have to talk to my oncologist and see the further findings with a biopsy! Im praying it's not serious! Thnk U for ""listening""."
"Everyone should get them"
"I don't care what they say. My routine mammogram has saved my life! My cancer was aggressive. Even with the routine mammograms it had gotten into the lymph nodes. Without the mammogram it would have spread throughout my body. My tumor was very deep and was very hard to feel. Don't let the insurance companies tell you you don't need yearly mammograms!"
"I thought mammography is what doctors use to look into the tissues without cutting one open? It found my grandmother's cancer ... I know it's uncomfortable, but I think I'd rather be squished than die"
"When something works ..dont try to fix it...mammograms are verrry important. ."
"Would not have found my cancer without it. Who are they trying to fool. It saved my life."
"Saved my life, wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my yearly mammogram"

"Breast Cancer is Sexist

Even if men can have breast cancer but it seem only women do. How can cancer or disease be sexist? It's seem that only women being target on purpose in the scam of all things that they do.

More than 1.3 millions US women had been falsely diagnose with breast cancer, only small % have life' threaten breast cancer but, media and associate had them scared and scam billions $$$$ of US citizen and government in form of advertisement, race marathon, donation, charity and grants.

Can we stopped ALS charity scam before it become the most profiting charity  scam like Breast Cancer Associations?

Breast Cancer is Sexist

In early 2012, the Susan G. Komen Foundation announced that it would be rescinding funding to Planned Parenthood; funding that had been used to provide breast cancer screenings to women with low-incomes. The group<U+2019>s claim that the decision to remove funding from Planned Parenthood was not based on the political views of Komen leadership was met with skepticism by many. Karen Handel, then senior vice president for public policy for Komen, ran on an anti-Planned Parenthood platform in her failed bid for governor of Georgia in 2010, adding fuel to the controversy.

Founder and CEO of the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Nancy Brinker, received a 64% raise in 2012, bringing along with it a salary of $684,000 a year.

<U+201C>This pay package is way outside the norm,<U+201D> said Ken Berger, CEO of Charity Navigator, an organization that evaluates charities. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s about a quarter of a million dollars more than what we see for charities of this size. <U+2026> This is more than the head of the Red Cross is making for an organization that is one-tenth the size of the Red Cross.<U+201D>

Cause Marketing

Cause marketing is when a for-profit organization teams with a non-profit charitable organization, often consisting of promotions that promise that a set percentage of proceeds on select items will go to the non-profit organization. Examples of this in the world of breast cancer include Yoplait<U+2019>s <U+201C>Save Lids to Save Lives<U+201D> campaign (Komen), the NFL<U+2019>s <U+201C>Crucial Catch<U+201D> campaign (American Cancer Society), and Kentucky Fried Chicken<U+2019>s <U+201C>Buckets for the Cure<U+201D> campaign (Komen).

like and share my page, thank you

https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1469725903290050

The goal of cause marketing is for a brand to benefit from positive public relations coverage as well as gaining the opportunity to win greater market share through cross-promotion and planting the idea in consumers<U+2019> minds that if they<U+2019>re already planning on spending money in a vertical, it might as well be with the business tied to the noble charity.

Komen<U+2019>s partnership with KFC reeked of cause dissonance. The supposed goal of this promotion was to <U+201C>save lives,<U+201D> but in reality, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in American women. One 8 piece bucket of KFC extra crispy chicken contains 2,380 calories and 160 grams of fat. Even if you split that bucket among 4 people, you<U+2019>re still looking at 595 calories (60% calories from fat) and 40 grams of fat. Additionally, the launch of the <U+201C>Buckets for the Cure<U+201D> campaign coincided with the launch of KFC<U+2019>s double-down sandwich, featuring pieces of fried chicken as the <U+201C>bread<U+201D> of the sandwich. You<U+2019>re either trying to save our lives or you<U+2019>re trying to kill us. Pick one, KFC.

Similarly, the NFL<U+2019>s <U+201C>Catch for a Cure<U+201D> campaign would be classified as cause marketing. If you turned on any of the NFL games this past weekend, you probably noticed that the fields had basically turned into a sea of pink. Players wore pink gloves, refs through pink flags, fans wore pink jerseys, and players ran towards pink first down lines. In the name of raising awareness, the NFL is doing its best to capitalize on an underrepresented demographic: women. In 2012, the NFL<U+2019>s contributions to the American Cancer Society as a result of the <U+201C>Catch for a Cure<U+201D> campaign, came in at $1.5 million. This represents 0.0188% of the NFL<U+2019>s operating revenue.

The Sexualization of Breast Cancer

Why exactly does breast cancer, above other forms of cancer, find itself the centerpiece of the cancer research/marketing field? For lack of a better way to phrase this: breasts are sexy.

<U+201C>Save the boobies!<U+201D> <U+201C>Save the ta-tas!<U+201D> <U+201C>Save Second Base!<U+201D> <U+201C>Feel Your Boobies!<U+201D>

These are all examples of actual lines organizations have used to promote breast cancer awareness. The American Cancer Society takes the cake with its own tag line: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s Okay to Look at Our Chests!<U+201D>

The sexualization of this all-too-real medical condition plays right into the classic marketing strategy of <U+201C>sex sells.<U+201D> Maybe so, but that doesn<U+2019>t make it right; and it certainly doesn<U+2019>t make it any less objectifying.

These slogans work to divide the woman, the human life at risk, from her breasts. When you say, <U+201C>save second base,<U+201D> you<U+2019>re not only playing into the idea that the value of a woman lies solely in her looks, but you<U+2019>re also suggesting that we should search for a cure for nothing else but to give men something to play with.

Breast cancer is serious, not sexy.

You don<U+2019>t see this type of marketing approach for other types of cancer. You wouldn<U+2019>t see a <U+201C>save the nuts!<U+201D> poster for testicular cancer awareness, would you? Why is it any more appropriate to say, <U+201C>save the boobies?<U+201D>

Conclusion

Do the ends justify the means? Is your hard earned money going towards the cause, or is it simply making its way to the pockets of NFL owners, yogurt conglomerates, auto dealerships and charity executives like Nancy Brinker<U+2019>s paycheck?

Breast cancer is a very real medical condition that will lead to the deaths of nearly 40,000 people this year, alone. If you<U+2019>re going to donate to this cause, I hope you do your research, find out how much of your money will be going towards research, screenings and treatment.

"lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the United States. In 1987, it surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer deaths in women.1

Lung cancer causes more deaths than the next three most common cancers combined (colon, breast and pancreatic). An estimated 159,260 Americans are expected to die from lung cancer in 2014, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths.2"

"Some ppl need to grow up... I could not even tell what she was doing.. Just saw her holding her baby."
"Seriously???? :/"
"Real awsome mom thumbs up"
"This is a beautiful picture"
"No woman bring life and nourishment there is nothing offensive about it .that it's life."
"She is beautiful!  Look at the joy and contentment on her face.  How could such a serene moment be anything but beautiful?"
"It's a beautiful picture, no matter if u see anything , people need to open there eyes, there is a lot of stupid things going on in this world and no one complaints! But giving life and nourishment to your child ! Really? Get a life people"
"I'm all for breastfeeding and do so when my 5 month old is hungry. Absolutely nothing wrong with feeding your baby whether it be breast or bottle."
"Beautiful"
"I believe in covering yourself, but this pic isn't as bad as some I have seen with the whole boob just hanging out.. Feeding a baby or not you should want to be covered, I feed in private"
"So beautiful. Congratulations on the baby good luck to you three"
"The actual picture shows boob and a lot of nipple because the baby is so tiny. However I don't find it offensive and I am glad that facebook reinstated it. now if they could just clean up the pictures of the friend suggestions!"
"Nope.... love it"
"This is betauful! !"
"Absolutely not! It's a beautiful picture of someone doing something that is very natural!"
"who cares, this is how everyone was fed years ago, before formula came into the picture!"
"This country is so uptight. We can show c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bre ties that show ass tits and damn near penis for meanings of being sexual.  And you all wanna get your feathers ruffled over a natural part of human life?you all need GPS one get back on the right track cause you all are in never never land"
"There's nothing wrong with it"
"This is what is considered obscene? In the meantime, there are half naked, pornographic photos filling up facebook, that when reported, are not removed because they do not violate any rules...I call BS..."
"Why do some people always have something negative to say about everything someone post?  What's wrong with a Mother feeding her baby?   Some people  just need to get a life period."
"Answer to post: No, I wouldn't mind. Seeing the vitriol and nefarious comments and schemes by the GOP is MUCH more offensive. This photo is compassion captured. No wonder conservatives hate it!"
"Its just so crazy how ignorant people. Are. There is nothing wrong with this picture. She's feeding her miracle baby. Nothing is showing. Some people thinks that this is wrong to see on fb but its ok to post men with their pants hanging off their asses.  What is this world coming to when a mother cant feed her child without someone getting offended."
"Yes"
"Omg for real?  That's just ridiculous. There is NOTHING wrong with the pic."
"Not at all"
"Breastfeeding is a beautiful and natural thing. Saying it is wrong to see in public, would be like saying a mother or father hugging their child in public is wrong."
"Being it on Facebook what mother would let her newborn child cry when he/she is hungry"
"Beautiful picture.   God bless that baby."
"No,  I wouldn't."
"The cover picture is a beautiful moment between a mother and her nursing baby. However if you read the whole article. The picture in question (I think) is of the full breast with the baby latched on to the nipple.  Of course its natural.  But the issue I believe that Facebook has is the Breast picture. Just a thought!"
"Like"
"No, I wouldn't mind.  Breast feeding is a natural part of life.  Get your minds out of the gutter people!"
"but the torture of animals is ok.  This is fine"
"Well the picture is a bit graphic, but that's what female breasts are for. If you can't deal with that, it's time to grow up and learn to deal with it."
"These are the most beautiful photos... Giving your baby the very best start in life."
"It's not this pic that was removed...click the pic and read the article and see the pic that was.  This pic here isn't bad, however the other one, I wouldn't put it on FB if it were me.  Too personal. IMO"
"I find the Victoria's Secret ads more offensive than a breastfeeding mother."
"Ridiculous closed minded people...this is the correct way to feed . Our babies"
"What!!! It's beautiful.  It's natural for moms to feed babies.  Unreal that some fool reported it."
"There is nothing wrong with mom breastfeeding their child. People have posted worst things than that."
"if people can't handle pics like this they need to grow up and get a life!!!  how do they think all babies were fed before the invention of baby formula!!??  i would rather see pics like this rather than pics of half naked girls showing more ""boob"" than a mother does feeding her child!!!"
"Too bad your mom didn't breast feed you.
   You noe breast arts meant to use to feed baby's. So poor countries where food is scarce they feed their kids long after baby's to keep their kids alive.
   If you don't want to watch someone feeding their child click off or you can keep your head buried in the sand.
  Even Mary the Mother of Jesus had to breast feed him.
   HIS FATHER GOD gave women these to use to provide food for HIS.
   They were not made for a.man's toys to play with"
"Ag come on.......what is the problem with this picture? This is a mom feeding her child. People should get their minds out of the gutter!"
"It's natural and a God given right...but rioting in the streets you have no problem with,thinking it's the rioters right to do so..Peoples moral compasses are completely screwed up.."
"And the difference between this mom feeding her baby, and a oh so cute dog feeding her babies is??? You have to feed your kids somehow. Get over it you idiodic freaks. Why is breastfeeding even a deal? It's how you feed a child so what's the problem? What is it you guys aren't getting? Oh, it grosses you out? Yea, well just know that when you were a baby, you were sucking on the tit too!"
"Id be pissed as I am now
yhis shit shouldn't be allowed on Facebook or anywhere
its disgusting
if I wanna see a baby getting feed ill watch my own while im feeding them 
its wrong to feed during treatment"
"having a c-section and wearing tight pants hummm"
"No"
"POSTED!!! Lock me up. I extended nursed - 4yrs.  <3"
"Why not you eat your dinner anywhere you want,why then can't the baby,who is helpless eat anywhere it is given it food"

"Breastfeeding is very important for Mums and babies, as it gives the child a better start in life and lowers the risk of breath cancer for Mum. It's being going on for forever, and new Mums shouldn't have to hide away to feed their child."

"Facebook is in all up in their asses about this beautiful bond with mother and child but they don't mind showing things about crimes committed against other humans and animals ..hmm what's up with that????  And besides this woman is NOT exposing herself...yeah its time closed minded people grew up."
"Absolutely cannot understand why ANYONE would have a problem with this. It is not as if you can see anything inappropriate. It is a beautiful picture of a mother and her baby."
"I understand that it's natural, but for myself, I wouldn't put a picture like that because I'm more of a private person with things like that. To each their own...she's not on my friends list so without the media blasting it I would have NEVER seen it. Guess she should rethink the friends on her page if that's who reported her...seems they may not be as supportive as they should be"
"Yes"
"Why would anyone be ""bothered"" by this?!!!"
"Nothing wrong in what I see myself I was done the same way by FB in the summer for posting a big bowl of blackberries makes no sense I have seen worse"
"Apparently some of you didn't open the article to see the actual picture.  I'm not against breastfeeding, but I do not need to see such a private moment between mother & child."
"Nope not a bit"
"Get over it people. The natural beauty of this is not to be criticized. (Unlike too many vulgar images I'd rather not see on FB. )"
"This is what breasts are for! Glad I got to see her special moment. So sweet."
"Really?? But no one gets 'bothered' by these stupid nasty videos girls post of themselves shaking their asses and rollin around on the floor and swinging from poles....get the f outta here...."
"For Christ's sake people! It's just a breast! Lighten up!"
"No"
"This bothers people? But profile pics of half naked girls never make this much noise? People need to get their priorities straight!!"
"Yeah. I mean really. Breastfeed in private.  Disgusting.  People get on my last nerve."
"Wow really people , get over it , a bunch of judgmental people ! Buts it's ok for half naked girls n women show more! Just WOW!!!!"
"Breast feeding is natural. I find this very beautiful. It's a bond she is sharing with her premie baby. Kudos to her for at least trying to give her baby the best possible. 

Also nudity has been sexualized by this society we live in. I am raising my boys to understand that a naked body is nothing to ogle over. It's just part of being human."
"No God made it that way a mom and baby is a beautiful thing"
"Of course NOT! This is a very natural thing!"
"This wasn't the picture that was reported. If you read the whole article it shows the pic that was reported. It also states that FB reinstated the pic after consideration and reiterated their policy on breast feeding photos. What a miracle and a beautiful moment !"
"It is a beautiful bonding moment between mother & child....WHY does it have to be shared with everyone else??? Its no longer a ""special"" bond cause you now have bonded with everyone else & strangers included on FB. And the half naked trashy pics of that are allowed are just that ""trashy pics"" that should absolutely NOT be allowed"
"Very well said Maria, just what I was going to say."
"Beautiful, it's not always but this photo has class!"
"No problem just glad it's not a 10 year old! :-)"
"I would rather see this sweet pic of a mother feeding her precious baby than pics some people post of women and their big butts! That is offensive to me!"
"Everyone needs to get their heads outta their butts! Its natural and this Lil one needs all the help it can get for being born early! This nation is so hypocritical about something so healthy. It may not be for all but stop judging women for something that's best for babies. Don't like don't look! And keep trucking. Seen the pics, but its okay for women to show their breast completely but not for a nursing mother...GET OVER IT! I SUPPORT IT <3"
"BEAUTIFUL"
"i am sick and tired of people fussing about breast feeding when miley cirus and a few others run around bare ass naked and its ok? whats wrong with that picture? both this country is really wierd aint it?"
"Most beautiful thing in the world."
"I don't care you should see the stuff people put on here. These are sweet pictures if you look at a mother breast feeding and your not thinking of Gratefulness holiness and how precious life is, then I'm afraid you are lost your mind and heart are diseased and wicked"
"No problem!"
"Nope nothing wrong to with that"
"You have up be a human to understand that special moment.  That day, that photo and the feeling of mother and child bonding will never be the same. Thank you for shareing something so special.  May your lived be forever changed !!!!"
"Can we say stupid!"
"A beautiful picture .. People need to let go and not be so uptight .. I feel bad for people who cannot accept the human body for what it is ... A body not a sex object ... We all are the same relax and find the real beauty in this photo .. A mother nursing her child ."
"What's the big deal?"
"well it is still porn.. so lets let private feeding be priovate.. women get just alil carried away to much"
"Don't mind at all.  After all this is the most natural function in the world.  Keep feeding ladies!"
"That is a beautiful picture"
"It wouldn't bother me. I've seen worse ""nudity"" photos in my news feed! People are dumb and childish"
"Carrie Decker :)"

"No problem with this photo at all! It's a natural thing x"
"Are they serious? Beautiful photo <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0097>"
"Doesn't bother me one bit!  This is normal and should not offend anyone.  Precious gift of life was given to a mother and she is taking care of her child God's normal way."
"No. Not sure why this would bother anyone?"
"Everyone else posts what they're eating for dinner, lunch, breakfast... so what, the baby is eating. Judy Lynn Brown if you think this is PORN, YOU are messed up. 
Breasts were created for feeding our babies, NOT sexual purposes..."
"It's not showing anything, people need to get over it"
"FB gets weird sometimes. Congrats on your baby!"
"Are you kidding? What is wrong with this pic? Nothing. America is just full of awful people that have nothing else to do but complain about things that don't matter. Seriously get over yourselves people. There are way more pressing issues going on in the world to worry about something that does not affect you IN ANY WAY."
"...it did show up on my newsfeed or I would not have seen it...."
"Its Beautifull"
"It's not obscene but it is a private moment to be kept with family. To force it on other people is hypocritical"
"How could this possibly be obscene???  There are pre-teens taking selfies and showing a lot more than this?!?!"
"No. It's better than what I usually see"
"Beautiful photo.  I don't know why people get offended by women breastfeeding,  first off you can't even see the woman's boob, second if people see it as a sexual thing then shame on those people. Women should be able to feed their babies without being rIdiculed."
"As long as men and, more specifically, women, sexualize breasts, breast feeding in public, and on public media will be frowned upon by the general public. I'd like to see what the women who complain about not being able to breast feed in public wear normally. Do they show their cleavage... wear ""push up bras"", etc..?"
"Don't want to see this, there is the FANTASTIC idea (comes highly reccommended) to just keep scrolling past it and not looking at it :)"
"Why is it necessary to post that picture?  Want to see the baby's face. This should be private."
"God bless your baby"
"Most natural thing on earth!"
"No because breasts are not for sex they're for feeding babies"
"I think it's a beautiful moment between Mama and baby .... When I nursed I did not care who was around to see... It's a very very natural part of life.  There are more things for us as a society to care about besides this.  This is natural."
"If it was a baby calf feeding from mama cow it would get a million shares and oh so cutes! What's the diff?!"
"Nothing wrong with this pic it's Beautiful it's only a mum feeding her baby ! What is wrong with that!"
"Beautiful and natural. God bless the little one!"
"Nothing wrong with this picture..its all natural and beautiful. :)"
"Some people need to grow up"
"This is one thing that makes me mad. So what if ppl are breast feeding their baby?! It's natural and better for the baby! Share those photos all u please and don't worry about ""who"" u might offend! God knows when I have my baby, I plan to breast feed anywhere my baby is hungry! If ppl don't like it then they don't have to look! Breast feeding has always been a problem in this world. It's just as bad a these young girls taking naked or half naked selfies and their photos don't get taken down! I mean really?!? I know someone who had a baby 2 days ago and they posted pictures of their new born daughter that was naked, someone reported it!? This is just crazy!!"

"Procommenter

A woman who's malnourished to the point of cancer is not a soldier. She is not automatically a candidate for sainthood. She is ignorant and ignorance exacts a toll. Surviving a train wreck isn't an act of bravery. Cancer is a measurable, easily explainable, regional, dietary disease. No one is afflicted with cancer as a turn of bad luck, for smoking cigarettes, or for having a cancer-stricken family. What makes regional? Diet. Diets are regional as they are traditional. The missing dietary factor is Amygdalin (vitamin B17)."

Dr. Lotze<U+2019>s Newsletter
""Vitamin B17 as the Cure for Cancer""

In the 1950s biochemist Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. isolated a substance that he designated vitamin B17 (a.k.a. Amygdalin). It started when he studied the habits of the tribe of the Hunza. In their culture cancer or tumors are unknown. They lived in what they called the""<U+2018>Kingdom of the Apricots."" Apricots are part of their main food, but they did not eat the fruit only, they also ate the kernels. Dr. Krebs isolated a substance in these kernels, which he named vitamin B17 and research confirmed that, once the body receives 50 to 75 m.g. of  vitamin B17 per day, it penetrates the membrane of cancerous cells and destroys these. B17 is in fact a cyanogenic glycoside, an anti-neoplastic substance, i.e. it destroys tumor cells. It also contains benzaldehyde, which is a powerful pain killer. Healthy cells contain the enzyme rhodanese, which blocks B17 from entering a healthy cell. Cancerous cells do not have this protective enzyme, so B17 can easily enter cancer cells and destroys them.

B17 (or laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips) is also present in macadamia nuts, millet, kernels of peaches, nectarines, cherries and plums.
Dr. Krebs presented his discoveries to the Second Annual Cancer Convention in Los Angeles in 1974. Since this discovery, millions of cancer patients could be cured in an inexpensive but very effective way.

However, in the U.S. $11 Billion (U.S.) are spend annually on <U+2018>conventional<U+2019> cancer treatments: chemo, surgery cryo-ablation (freezing) and radiation.

Dr. Earl Mindell writes in his Vitamin Bible (1982) ""Vitamin B17 touted as a cancer treatment in most of the United States at this date and legal in fifteen states but rejected by the Food and Drug Administration on the grounds that it might be poisonous due to its cyanide content...A deficiency may lead to diminished resistance to cancer."""

It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress.

To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya. Supplement your diet with the nutrients (of which 95% of Americans are chronically deficient) that compliment Laetrile (vitamin B17):  <U+2460> zinc (which is the transport mechanism for Laetrile/vitamin B17) <U+2461> vitamin C (build up to 6 grams a day) <U+2462><U+FEFF> manganese <U+2463> magnesium <U+2464> selenium <U+2465> vitamins B6, B9 & B12 <U+2466> vitamin A <U+2467> vitamin E (at least 2,000 I.U.)

IN BRIEF Concerning Cancer: 1. Take a pregnancy test just after waking up. For men a positive result means either cancer or a false positive. Take another test the next day. If a man gets 3 positive results then likely he has cancer somewhere. For women a positive result means (if she's able to become pregnant) she's pregnant or she has cancer, or she's pregnant and she has cancer, or a false positive (the test result is wrong). 

2. Several positive pregnancy test results = cancer. What next? STOP eating red meat, sugar, corn syrup. STOP drinking booze. STOP (or at least cut back on) smoking.

3. Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. Take vitamin B17 (at least 1 gram daily) and wheat grass and/or barley grass liquid or capsules (they're rich in vitamin B17), on a full stomach daily (you can't overdose on them ~ they're not poisonous). Take a zinc supplement. Take pancreatic enzymes.  

Since 2009 I have ordered vitamin B17 from Metabolic Products in California. 500 m.g. costs 87 cents. My mother is 79. She's been taking a gram per day for a year. Her pregnancy tests were positive in June 2013. They're negative now. I told her that she could cut her daily dose of vitamin B17 from 1,000 m.g. to 100 m.g. now that she's cancer-free but she insists on taking the high dose as it's made her fingernails harder and her hair thicker.

REVIEW: TAKE pregnancy tests to detect cancer. TAKE vitamin B17 (and as many of the listed vitamins as you can, especially zinc). Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. STOP eating red meat & cane sugar. It will take several weeks on B17 therapy to turn out negative pregnancy test results. The tumor WILL NOT shrink much even after the cancer is gone because only 10% of the tumor was cancer. The tumor MAY swell temporarily as the vitamin B17 kills malignant cells.

NOTE: Vitamin B17 therapy WILL NOT destroy the tumor! Vitamin B17 therapy will destroy the malignant cells (cancerous cells) of the tumor and within the tumor. Only 5% to 10% of the cells comprising a tumor are cancerous cells. In time the tumorous growth will be absorbed, in whole or in part. Unless the tumor is cosmetically displeasing, impinging nerves or blood vessels or hampering normal bodily function then let it be.

Resveratrol & prevention of cancer

Second to heart disease, Cancer as a leading cause of death, is speculated to be the number-one cause of death worldwide by 2010. However, in various studies reviewed by the National Institute of Health, leading researchers found that Resveratrol inhibits the growth of many types of cancer cells, including leukemia, skin and prostate cancers, and reduces the incidence of tumors.

"Well 6 rounds of chemo and 3/of those was red devil. And 33/rounds of radiation and 3 breast operation double,full reconstruction. Then fluid filled behind them and another operation. Made 3 times, and all my lymnnodes removed from right. Stage and grade 3. Then cancer free for 4 years
Now return I have metastatic cancer in my bones chest and lymnnodes and spine. 2 years or less to live so nope my 3 breast surgery doesn't look or feel great. And have stage 4 doesn't either"
"Actually, I'm not celebrating having had cancer and surgery but my body is indeed a better shape overall, albeit I'm missing a nipple."
"Prayers going out to all survivors and fighters, I am a miracle of God, I had to much medication for my system one night and went into an altered state so they did an MRI and found holes in my skull while checking to see if I had suffered a stroke. After finding them they thought it was Multiple Myeloma that had traveled from soft tissue, so they did a Mammogram and found a small suspicious area. They did a biopsy and found Ductal Carcinoma the non aggressive type so they did a lumpectomy. When they examined the lump it was free of cancer and so were my lymph nodes, I claim a miracle of God that they took it all in the biopsy in 2012 going for Mammograms this month but so far 3 years breast cancer free. The only thing is the holes in the skull are larger but not by a lot they will do a biopsy this month of the skull and scans of all my bones. It's an ongoing job to keep on top of any and all symptoms when we are survivors but it becomes routine. God Bless my sisters and brothers breast cancer survivors."

"90% of what Planned Parenthood does is ABORTIONS.  That is why Congress has halted funding to Planned Parenthood.  Do Not confuse it with Ms. Komen's organization.  Ms. Susan Komen is an icon that must seperate her organization from Planned Parenthood 100%, and support those organizations that actually give help to cancer patients."

"I live in the US, and had my first PAP at 16.  I've had one every year since."
"here in australia you starting getting pap smears when you become sexually active, your doctor has your records, and will remind you its due. you can also register to have a reminder sent to you by mail or email. i can't believe there is an age limit on this anywhere, especially when you are having problems like this young lady. her doctor should be sued, won't bring Emma back but her doctor would never be in a position to do this to another woman again."
"Once I turned 18, it was in the recommended once a year list. How are you too young for a Pap smear?"
"This last pregnancy I wasn't given a pelvic exam until I practically demanded it. 
I trust my doctors, but no one will look out for you better than you! 
Make. Them. Test. You. 
Get a second opinion, if needed."
"i had my first pap at 16....my niece had one since she was 16..at 19 she changed doctors because of the pain she was in and he kept telling her it was the begininigs of endometriosis...and giving her pain pills and doing nothing..her mom made her switch docs...she had cervical cancer..stage 2...either the lab was wrong for years or the doc simply could not read the reports...smh...she is fine and dandy now...but had a scrape and then later a freeze...and finally had one child, after being told becaue of the freeze that may never happen....my oldest niece was older in her early 50's, had a pap...didnt call the doc back for the results..thought he would call...starting having issues  a year later..went back..they told her then she had cancer and was supposed to have called them back...too later for her..it had spread everywhere..she was lost to us....smh...over a phone call.....how can u be too young???? but in the UK, its state run medical services...my friends from there tell me its a horror trying to get anything done...and it is not simple to change doctors....smh...sad"
"At 16 I found out I had a mass on my ovarie and they took it out when I was 18 and I had to wait til I was 21 to get a pap done. And I have to wait til I'm 39 to get a mammogram even though my mom is a survivor of breast cancer, all because my insurance doesn't cover it til then."
"Really sad story ! Prevention or finding out the early stage , is what you can do best ! If your doctor is ignorant & careless , to simply test you , don't hesitate , go find another one ! cancer has no age barriers ...."
"Allison on my last yearly I was told they no longer due Pap smear yearly unless there are markers that require it. I was like huh? I had breast cancer I want a Pap smear he said in sorry everything is normal according to your guideline again huh? I pay an exuberant amount of money for health insurance give me the damn test!"
"I started having paps regularly at 16,  shortly after starting birth control. I had one annually until i was 21 when i began having them biannually. I thought this was standard practice for every breeding age woman, i guess i was just lucky to have a decent doctor."
"So sad. We women need to stand up and demand to change the laws on Cancer. Even at 16 yrs old, it is better than what USA is!"
"You must be going to some crappy doctors. I've had 1 every year since I was 16. They insist on it."
"We<U+2019>re hosting a fundraising campaign for our friend against breast cancer. Hope you can contribute a little to her or just share this <U+201C>Story inside Toilet Paper Rolls<U+201D> on your social network. Every single sharing click makes a difference. That would help her overcome difficulty and encourage other women with positive attitude against breast cancer diagnosis. Thank you. https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/312fbb/ab/d599D4"
"I have gotten the 'don't worry you are young' response from doctors before. I won't take that anymore. Having my sister diagnosed with Breast cancer and a cousin diagnosed with Thyroid cancer all before the age of 35 has changed the playing field. Ladies ..please get checked and find a doctor who will listen and care. <3"
"I guess they don't get birth control until they are 25 either???"
"had my 1st one at 21, if you are having problems you should be able to get tests that are needed, this should have nothing to do with age"
"How can you put an age on cancer?????  Something must change"
"I was nervous at my very first, but went anyway, and since then have been in and out due to issues with my cervix, if i had left it for years then I'd no doubt be dead by now. Every time a friend tells me they didn't go I tell them horror stories of when people don't, and my luck that i went. Ice underwent 2 treatments so far and awaiting more. I'm lucky, never tempt fate ladiesa"
"You should have your first Pap, when you become sexually active, regardless of your age...."
"Breast Cancer

Checking your breasts regularly
Upper chest and armpits too,
Is crucial to early diagnosis
Know what is normal to you.

Lumps, thickening of breast tissue
One breast becomes larger or lower,
Make sure you attend breast screening
If you are seventy or over?

Everyone<U+2019>s breasts are different
Different times of the month and age,
Lookout for changes unusual to you
If worried? GP please engage.

Puckering or dimpling of the skin
Continuous pain causing strife,
Reporting changes without delay
Can make a difference to your life.

Have your nipples inverted (turned in)?
Have they changed shape or position?
Developing a rash, crusting or discharge
If any of these? It<U+2019>s your mission.

Make an appointment with your GP
Remember this is your body,
Early diagnosis can make a difference
Better to be safe than sorry.

"Why God let this thing happens to women? So heartbreaking."
"So sad that a life was cut too short because of the medical field and their almost lack of knowledge when it comes to women and our health. 
I was told last year that a pap only needs to be done every 3 years now unless you have an abnormal one. 
I still request it yearly but they ""frown"" upon the request and try to talk me out of it. I have to tell them exactly what tests to order bc I've had them not order the pap or certain screenings only to have to go through it again so they get it right. And this is in the US."
"so sad RIP Emma x"
"Sad sorry."
"While there are some exams that have age requirements, if a person is having issues and will benefit from having the test done early, the doctor can order it.  I know it's done all the time in the U.S. with mammograms and colonoscopies and it doesn't make sense not to administer a potentially life saving exam because of an unreliable age requirement."

"Wow. The U.K. needs to get with the program. No routine paps until 25??   Started mine at 16 too (the U.S.).   And scary that there is talk about not needing them annually anymore.  We all need to request, or demand, them annually.  Such a sad story"

"I'm 23 and I had a papsmear at the end of last year and I was 22  the outcome was normal but last week I wasn't feeling right so I asked for one and I was refused feeling frustrated I went back and demanded one and yes it has come back abnormal (precancerous cells)  but the point is NO Dr should refuse you no matter what age you are. I think that the importance of having regular papsmears should be encouraged alot more also."

"Having had some permanent  left side paralysis, I had to become my own advocate. In that I could not do a proper self exam on my right side with my left OR right hand so I probably had my first true mammogram before my 30's....  When you are married   and the doctor says ""Have your husband  help you. LOL Yea right He thinks they are TOYS!!!""  Unfortunately I have had to rely strictly on extensive mammogram films and a needle biopsy(left side) to surgically remove  a ""lump"" and then the    ""wait"" to determine if it's benign..   Once I  found out it was all I could do was look up and say  ""Thank You"" and text  ""PTL""  to people I had  been keeping updated. I know I was blessed that it was not cancerous or malignant and did not have to go through radiation or chemo......."

"My sister is a survivor but I have lost people I loved to breast cancer. And friends have suffered terribly. We should be spending a hell of a lot more on cancer cures."
"I am a believer in disagreeing when something doesn't feel right.  2 weeks before I was to turn 40, I  had my annual exam.  My Doc didn't want to do a mammogram beause I hadn't reached 40 yet.  I begged to differ and thank goodness I did.  After the mammogram came the ultrasound, then the mri then the many biopsies.  Then came the lumpectomy with a diagnosis of ALH.  Thank goodness I insisted to take control of my health and well being.  Always listen to your senses, as you know your body better than anyone.....even your doctor."
"Don't ever listen when a doctor says it wont grow are it will go away I was 21 when I found a lump pregnant with my daughter and he told me it wouldn't grow.I carried it for 6 years and I notice it growing but didn't think of it to talk to another doctor until I had a physical with a girl doctor she sent me back to a breast care facility and found out after they removed it was a size of a grapefruit.These doctors did test on it wasn't cancer but the doctor told me if I left it go any longer it could have been.So never over look a lump just because a doctors says its fine."
"Dont ever tell yourself you are too young or have no family Hx....I saw it too many times!!!  Check yourself and get your mammograms!!!!!"

5)Antitumor activity of plant cannabinoids with emphasis on the effect of cannabidiol on human breast carcinoma. (2006)
""Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exhibits antitumor effects on various cancer cell types, but its use in chemotherapy is limited by its psychotropic activity. We investigated the antitumor activities of other plant cannabinoids, i.e., cannabidiol, cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabidiol acid and THC acid, and assessed whether there is any advantage in using Cannabis extracts (enriched in either cannabidiol or THC) over pure cannabinoids. Results obtained in a panel of tumor cell lines clearly indicate that, of the five natural compounds tested, cannabidiol is the most potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth (IC(50) between 6.0 and 10.6 microM), with significantly lower potency in noncancer cells.""

8)Cannabinoids: a new hope for breast cancer therapy? (2012)
<U+201C>Experimental evidence accumulated during the last decade supports that cannabinoids, the active components of Cannabis sativa and their derivatives, possess anticancer activity. Thus, these compounds exert anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-migratory and anti-invasive actions in a wide spectrum of cancer cells in culture. Moreover, tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis are hampered by cannabinoids in xenograft-based and genetically-engineered mouse models of cancer.<U+201D>

4)Cannabidiol as a novel inhibitor of Id-1 gene expression in aggressive breast cancer cells.(2007)
""In conclusion, CBD represents the first nontoxic exogenous agent that can significantly decrease Id-1 expression in metastatic breast cancer cells leading to the down-regulation of tumor aggressiveness.""
 McAllister S., et al. Cannabidiol as a novel inhibitor of Id-1 gene expression in aggressive breast cancer cells.Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Nov;6(11):2921-7  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18025276

5)Antitumor activity of plant cannabinoids with emphasis on the effect of cannabidiol on human breast carcinoma. (2006)
""Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exhibits antitumor effects on various cancer cell types, but its use in chemotherapy is limited by its psychotropic activity. We investigated the antitumor activities of other plant cannabinoids, i.e., cannabidiol, cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabidiol acid and THC acid, and assessed whether there is any advantage in using Cannabis extracts (enriched in either cannabidiol or THC) over pure cannabinoids. Results obtained in a panel of tumor cell lines clearly indicate that, of the five natural compounds tested, cannabidiol is the most potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth (IC(50) between 6.0 and 10.6 microM), with significantly lower potency in noncancer cells.""

6)Cannabidiol induces programmed cell death in breast cancer cells by coordinating the cross-talk between apoptosis and autophagy (2011)
""Cannabidiol (CBD), a major nonpsychoactive constituent of cannabis, is considered an antineoplastic agent on the basis of its in vitro and in vivo activity against tumor cells""
Shrivastava A. et al. Cannabidiol induces programmed cell death in breast cancer cells by coordinating the cross-talk between apoptosis and autophagy. Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Jul;10(7):1161-72. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-1100. Epub 2011 May 12.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21566064

7)Pathways mediating the effects of cannabidiol on the reduction of breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (2011)
""Using immune competent mice, we then show that treatment with CBD significantly reduces primary tumor mass as well as the size and number of lung metastatic foci in two models of metastasis. Our data demonstrate the efficacy of CBD in pre-clinical models of breast cancer.""
Moore D.; et al.Pathways mediating the effects of cannabidiol on the reduction of breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2011 Aug;129(1):37-47. doi: 10.1007/s10549-010-1177-4. Epub 2010 Sep 22.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20859676

8)Cannabinoids: a new hope for breast cancer therapy? (2012)
<U+201C>Experimental evidence accumulated during the last decade supports that cannabinoids, the active components of Cannabis sativa and their derivatives, possess anticancer activity. Thus, these compounds exert anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-migratory and anti-invasive actions in a wide spectrum of cancer cells in culture. Moreover, tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis are hampered by cannabinoids in xenograft-based and genetically-engineered mouse models of cancer.<U+201D>
 Caffarel, M., et. al.  Cannabinoids: a new hope for breast cancer therapy? Cancer Treat Rev. 2012 Nov;38(7):911-8. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22776349

9)JunD is involved in the antiproliferative effect of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol on human breast cancer cells. (2008)
<U+201C>In summary, this is the first report showing not only that cannabinoids regulate JunD but, more generally, that JunD activation reduces the proliferation of cancer cells, which points to a new target to inhibit breast cancer.<U+201D>

"BS"
"As another reader pointed out,  ""Over a 10-year period, and from brand to brand, the waist circumference of a size 12 is not a constant, and therefore not a useful proxy.""  I've seen studies stating similar cause and effect on skirt lengths and the stock market -- equally flawed. If this article is meant to say that exercise and diet could play a big part in breast cancer, ok. But to relate it to something as changeable as a SKIRT SIZE??  Nuts!  AND ... I believe it's more harmful to drive on an interstate freeway, or one like the M5 in the UK and inhale those car toxins than it is to get a bit of tummy over the years!  External, environmental causation of BC is rarely discussed, it is ALWAYS some kind of ""blame the woman"" gambit, such as this.  It's NOT helpful - its quite the reverse."

"I'm a month  out from by bi lateral  mastectomy.  Had major dcis in the left breast and invasive  cancer in the right breast that I didn't  even know was there until  the pathology  report.  Thank  goodness i choose  to  take both because  now I'm cancer free! The day I was diagnosed  I just made up my mind right there that this little thing called cancer wasn't going to  stop me. I'm a fighter, I am a winner!"
"I remember that day so well. I had been screened for breast cancer early on because of the strong family history on my mom's side. I go back now and read my journal which I started the day after. Had a 2 pronged tumor and they did not know if the cancer cells were already out there in other areas. So the week after were full of many tests and dr. visits. It had not gone out anywhere else but did go to my lymph nodes under my right arm. After 3 surgeries and treatments I am now going into my 7th cancer free year! My husband was with me when I was told and I kind of remember that my mind wen black and could not respond for awhile. My surgeon and his nurses took great care of me and I remember coming home and letting the tears outt. I felt like I was looking at things through different eyes. Many emotions but had to concentrate on what was ahead of me and am blessed with a very supportive husband, friends and people who became my friends through those years. I am a very open person and hoped I could help others who walked or who are walking this same path. Bless you all!"
"Went for my Mammogram at Breast Care the Dr showed me the lump, had a biopsy in the office I went to the car with my husband and cried three days later it was confirmed.  After a mastectomy we have only looked forward that was 17 years ago."
"I went numb. I knew before the biopsy it was cancer. I cried &  told my husband I didn't want to die. Gathered strength & never looked back!"
"Its one year ago this month I was in a State of Shock wen I found out completely no emotions until the radiation than Major DEpression set in.I'm ok now and look forward to the future.........."
"Please find a cure for Metastatic Breast cancer!"
"I knew from seeing my condition on Web MD. So I went to my Gyn and went thru testing. Radiologist freaked out when I told him I was going to Vegas that weekend. My sister Denise and I took a long time trying to decide on date when we could get our schedules co ordinated for a Vegas trip. I also knew what my dad went thru back in '81. May as well go and enjoy myself while I can.  And I did- best time with my best friend. Breast cancer was a mass and I had a 40% chance of survival.( Better than 30%)  2X survivor (it metasis to my brain) Terminal diagnosis."
"I went totally numb and couldn't breathe. The breath that that doctor took before telling me ""the good news is that it's treatable"" felt like an absolute eternity. Its 2 years since my diagnosis."
"It happened to me twice in 10 yrs.2nd time a masectomy on my left breast. I am happy where I am in remission. Every six months, I get nervous before dr's apptmnt. Still positive."
"I went for a base line mammogram at 35 expecting to walk out and not returning for 5 years. I knew there was a problem when the technician kept on coming back about 3 times to get a closer picture. Finally went into doctors office and she told me I had breast cancer. I walked out of office totally numb. I was since diagnosed at age 39 and 44. I currently a very healthy 57 year old<ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BE><U+0080>"
"I was told 22 1/2 years ago at the age of 33 that I had breast cancer! I remember it like it was yesterday.........I was told the results were in and I had to go to the office. When I was told it was Cancer, I went totally numb, blank and scared to death! I have been Cancer Free for 22 1/2 years and Loving Life!"
"""You have cancer,"" said my GYN. I know she said a lot more. Thank goodness my hubby was sitting right next to me listening to what she went on too say. Still don't remember what else my GYN said after ""you have cancer"" but this I do....Beeeeeeeeeeeeeppppppppppppppppppppppppppp, is all  I heard till we got to our car in the parking lot of her office.

"Once I had the biopsy I think I knew deep down it was cancer.  The confirmation phone call wasn't very shocking but I do remember not being able to breathe."
"I'm adopted.  So didn't know any history.   Went for a routine mammogram. In one year there was the lump.    I was lucky found it fairly early.   Lumpectomy and two more surgeries.      14 years still going strong."
"I had to fight for a biopsy, the first Doctor said they do not do cyst. When I did get some one to listen my biopsy looked like ice tea. That is when I knew I had breast cancer. When the Doctor called and said to come in I was ready for the news. My husband was not or my children. I made a choice that I was going to fight. Always go for second append. It saved my life. I pray for all of you, God Bless"
"Shock, I think, was the first feeling. There were no symptoms, no signs. It was found through a biopsy. I was very fortunate, and very Blessed, through my diagnosis and treatment, but it sure was an eye opener and a life changer."
"I was in a meeting and phone was turned off.  When we came out. I returned the call, the silly young receptionist was annoyed that I was asking to speak to the doctor or her nurse and told me that they had set up an appointment with the surgeon! Talk about shock, I hadn't even known it was positive!!  The doc called and apologized later. Fortunately, we caught it early and a lumpectomy was in the cards for me.  That was 4 years ago,  2011."
"When I went to the doc's after finding a lump, she teared up. Uh oh. Then when the pathologist said ""considerable carcinoma"" during my ultrasound, I replied, ""you just said a bad word"". She took my hand and told me there was no easy way to say the bad word. I started to shake uncontrollably. Now, eleven years cancer free!"

"Mom, grandma, aunt and cousin all had BC.  I had brac1 which was negative. Afterwards had mammogram which came up clear but I insisted on a breast ultrasound and found stage 1 Hormone positive.   Had bilateral mastectomy in dec.  had an infection which stopped me from any implant reconstruction.   Insist on every test available.  If you hear no, dispute it or pay for the ultrasound yourself    $179 is worth your life."
"I had it done  cause cancer  runs in my  dad's side of the  family  and mine came back   negative  thank god my dad passed away  from  breast cancer and  his mom and  his aunt"
"I had the BRCA testing done..... for my 2, 40 ish girls. The test was negative for the gene.  It gave  me and my girls peace of mind.  Yes, they may get breast cancer, but it won't be inherited from me."
"I am BRCA negative.. But I had a mastectomy for a phyllodes tumor and a hysterectomy..My mom passed with stage 4 breast cancer at 53."
"I would love to be tested cause my dad's mom is the survivor of (Breast) cancer on both sides of my family (we have leukemia, and 3 different types of cancer in my family that both my grandpas, my cousin, & Aunt died from). Unfortunately Military insurance won't cover the testing unless my parents or sibling/s have had it. I'm an only child & my dad died from another horrible heriditary disease."
"I had it done I was brac 1 positive my mom had breast and ovarian cancer..she   has since passed. I would recommend to have it done. I chose double mastectomy and I had a 21 cm tumor on my ovary and had a total  hysterectomy."
"I had it done for my daughter's sake. I found out I do not carry the gene.   I forgot to previously mention that I had undergone treatment last year for breat cancer."
"I got tested for my half sisters sake. Negative....it was environmental. I would definitely do it again and if I were in the other shoes I would want to know and if it would happen to be positive I would be very proactive and take whatever measures needed to keep me from chemotherapy. Chemotherapy saved my life but I would avoid it at all costs if given the chance. It's been six years and I still have side effects. And I only had cancer in one breast but was proactive and had a double mastectomy and silicone implants. I am not the same person I once was but have never regretted the decision."
"I had the gene test when I was 20 and I had the gene brac1 and brac2 so couple months later I was scheduled for a double mastectomy was a very hard decision but having my 2 year old daughter at that time is what made me do it as I did not want her not knowing me as my mum passed away when I was 5 and she was 25 a young woman herself. I have just had the ovaries removed last year and I could do that as have 2 gorgeous daughter I now worry about them aged 13 and 7 as I don't want them to worry about anything like this x they will be gene checked in time x"

"TLC products Vs #Cancer! Testimony By Armand Puyolt 

First #Armand Puyolt has an awesome Testimonial about IASO #Gano, IASO #Chaga, IASO #Nutraburst and IASO #Techui which helped him to battle with Cancer. Today 5 Years later he is still cancer free having not had Chemo. Secondly, as long as their doctor says they can eat they can take IASO Gano, IASO Chaga and IASO Techui. Heavy Doses 4 -5 A Day. The active anti-cancer constituents in Ganoderma Luiciden are called Beta-D-glucan.
 Beta-D-glucan is a polysaccharide basically a huge sugar molecule made up of many little sugar molecules chained together bound to amino acids. These intricate sugars stimulate or modulate the immune system by activating immune cells such as macrophage and helper T-cells, as well as increase the immunoglobin levels (immunoglobins are specific types of antibodies) to produce a heightened response to foreign cells, whether bacteria, viruses, or tumor cells. Documented by:Morishige, Fukumi, 1987. Chinese Traditional Medicine Part III, Page 12 - 23, ISBN4-88580-053-6 C-0077. The Chaga plant has been documented to destroy cancer cells in your body. It is a POSITVE parasite. It litereally eats the negative in your body getting rid of what is not suppose to be there. Think of it as Destroyer of illness at that very moment. Chaga grabs it, destroys it, and will prevent it at will.

"The Budwig anti cancer diet is fascinating. it's a healthy diet to fight cancer and this little heard of German doctor should not be overlooked. x"
"ALL Facebook cancer sites are pity parties. People are beat down by a disease that afflicted 3% of the American citizenry in A.D. 1900 to a projected 50% by year 2020. A fact that few people know: a cancer patient who dies from an opportunistic infection during immunologically-suppressive chemico-/radio-/cryo-ablative ""therapies"" is statistically a cancer-treatment success story. Currently cardiovascular disease & cancer alternate as #1 & #2 in regards to leading causes of death. Unsurprisingly, folks who succumb to heart attacks, aneurysms & strokes had cancer while those who died of cancer were cardiac patients taking prescribed blood thinners & statins. It's a mad dash to the grave between these 2 diseases of malnutrition."
"We pray for knowledge & guidance rather than a divine suspension of physical law. The Creator provides in His bounty the cures for diseases. The cure for crab cancer is found within fruit seeds (except American citrus), brown rice, bitter almonds (not sweet almonds) etc. NO DISEASE is cured by hypothermic gradation, toxication, mutilation, ablation, extirpation or irradiation."

"WEB: ""The Army Tested Chemicals on Residents of Poor, Black St. Louis Neighborhoods in The 1950s"" ~ In the early 1950s, the army set up motorized blowers on top of residential high-rises in low-income, mostly black St. Louis neighborhoods, including areas where as much as 70% of the residents were children under 12. The government told residents that it was experimenting with a smokescreen to protect the city from Russian attacks, but it was actually pumping the air full of hundreds of pounds of finely powdered zinc cadmium sulfide. The government admits that there was a second ingredient in the chemical powder, but whether or not that ingredient was radioactive remains classified. Of course it does."

In honor of my late wife Fannilia Celia Richardson, who lost her battle with breast cancer at the young age of 30. I am creating a ""Cancer Awareness Music Theater"" that will have a nationwide impact. An association and national contingency that will  give speeches and performances to highlight and elevate the fight against cancer for national <U+201C>Cancer Awareness<U+201D> For this generation and future generations to come, so that we can be fully prepared and also succeed, in this battle. There are 12 dominant cancers that  are taking us by storm and rapidly killing our wives, mothers, sisters, brothers and fathers, and friends because cancer does not discriminate whether it be age, creed, or race. My vision and Fannilia<U+2019>s Cancer Awareness Theater will make a difference in this world and save many lives.

Please feel free to donate to this amazing project that will do positive deeds and wonders through out the world where Cancer Awareness Is Concern.

P.S: In my 3 decade of my music career after loosing my wife to Breast Cancer on December 10th 2014 my interest is to produce my first music video which is also in honor of my wife Fannilia Celia Bell- Richardson beside the Cancer Awareness Theater I'm in process of raising funds for via We Share Crowd Funding which my composition is: Entitle <U+201C> The Curse Of Cancer <U+201C> which soothe the heart to does that lost someone to cancer.

"Be aware The cure is here. Let us recognize this!  Pennies in action. Breakthrough ending breast cancer"
"my wife when through 10 different surgery ,  an several in office biopsies an in hospital biopsies,  i truely can't believe how strong women are,  you'll do fine gayle   keep up the good work ."
"Lumpectomy, double mastectomy with reconstruction, infection, complications, 5 surgeries, 10 years of oral chemo. 2 year survivor. I love the pink! In my opinion, the going bra less day was taken out of context. I believe it was meant to send a message ""take of the bra and get a mammogram"". I can't be bitter. I fought. I won. How can one be bitter because you SURVIVED the hell that breast cancer brings? 

In the month of October I make a facebook post everyday with a reminder for women to get a mammogram. The post usually has a picture, or a story or something educational. But it works. Friends and family get their mammograms and post their good or bad results. A friend sent me a message, and I quote, ""Thank you for reminding me to get a mammogram. I always thought  you were an inspiration. I just never knew it would be for me. Now my cancer journey begins"".  So remember ladies and gentlemen, just one reminder equals a mammogram equals early detection equals a life saved.  Life is short. Pink it up!"
"I hate October- all those cute pink things that people are throwing away their money on. What's wrong with just donating to cancer organizations of your choice where the money goes to research and not the manufacture of junk or to administrative costs. I had a double mastectomy - no bra day is irrelevant to me."
"Thanks... Well said! I'm sure all those bra less woman .. Have no idea.. What real survivors have been through!"
"I'm a survivor and have had a total of 32 surgeries in the past 5 years due to various complications.  If wearing no bra, wearing pink, or watching football players wear pink makes someone smile then I say do it.  Not every survivor has anger issues.  Lighten up ladies and have some fun!!!"
"Lumpectomy, radiation, Tamoxifen, recurrence, bilateral mastectomy, no reconstruction, scar revision, hysterectomy..... Thank you to those who made donations that made a difference and thank you to those who kept their bras on on the 13th."
"I'm a breast cancer survivor and I think the no bra day is absolutely insulting and ridiculous!!"
"Lumpectomy , radiation , 7 year survivor ."
"I get that this irritates those of us who have been through breast cancer and what it does to our bodies. I do, though, welcome October and breast cancer awareness....if it makes just one person think about it and go get a mammogram, then it's worth it. I think people mean well, they just don't get it. Until you have been through the diagnosis, treatment, etc. you wouldn't get it. That doesn't mean people don't mean well....they are doing what they think is helpful, so that is not to be criticized...just become more informed!"
"What  !! No Bra Day ? I have no breasts because i had cancer what does no bra day have to do with that. I would love to not wear a bra with prosthetics , they are a pain !! It doesn't make anyone more aware as far as I'm concerned. Hey instead of hanging those stupid bras every where they should throw their old bras away and donate to help women that cant afford  breast cancer or donate to research ! I am a survivor today and I thank god for helping me with my toughest moments ."
"My mum has breast cancer and had a single mastectomy nearly 2 yrs ago. The journeys not over yet and all this no bra no makeup selfie rubbish makes my blood boil. They say it's to raise awareness but I find it insulting maybe that's because I'm angry that this has got my mum and I'm scared to death of losing her !"
"My surgery is Thursday. Double mastectomy!! Then Chemo. Possibly radiation ( God Bless each of you!! ) This is by far the most difficult journey ever!!!  ."
"I am a 2 year survivor and I honestly do not care what people try to do to promote breast cancer awareness.  Whether it's no bra day, pink things...it doesn't really matter, all that matters is that this propaganda makes women/men think about breast health. Let people wear zebra stripes and walk on their hands, I do not care as long as they do SBE and get mammograms regularly!!"
"Totally agree with you. Get a mammogram. Donate to research or to help pay for mammograms. I had a double mastectomy and reconstruction and also don't wear a bra and did chemo. Awareness and being proactive helps -- NOT gimmicks."
"I'm a breast cancer survivor but didn't go through a mastectomy. My friend did, though!  
I love seeing the NFL and other people wear pink and Run/Walk in charity events. I feel the no bra day or the show your strap day is ignorant and insensitive to women who have survived breast cancer, whether we have had a mastectomy or not!"
"I agree! I'm not wearing a bra right now, although I am fortunate in that my cancer could be addressed with a lumpectomy. After three surgeries, and five months of chemo, I am now having two months of radiation, and the skin where the radiation is aimed is too fragile to wear a bra. There is nothing cute about fighting breast cancer. Women walking around with no bra ""for the cause"" is not helpful, unless they donated to a reputable cancer research organization first."
"I've had breast cancer twice. I stopped counting after 10 surgeries. I've had so much chemo that they can barely find a useful vein to just draw blood to send it for lab work. I had to choose between radiation treatment and spending time with my dying father. I thank God for my survival and the support of others. I've struggled with survivor guilt when I witnessed peers, friends or colleagues much younger than me loose the fight. But  pink does not offend me. The games do not anger me. Braless women and men in pink in football uniforms certainly don't understand all I've been through but I have to appreciate that their efforts (though misguided and maybe a tad off the mark) are at least something that people are doing to show support when they don't know what else to do or say in these situations. I agree with Felicia Edmund Ferragamo... Lighten up. And yes if you have the $$$ of course donate or do something that does make a difference.  But try to understand that not everyone can give financially. What they are doing may not be perfect but they care enough to try and support us as we fight an illness that has affected millions of women AND men"
"I've had double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. 14 rounds of chemo and two more surgeries. I finished in September 2015. I have bras but some days they are uncomfortable with my implants so I take it off. Please don't insult people on no bra day. Some may be doing it to support all the women. But you are untitled to your opinion."
"Woman burned their bras back in the 60's, now woman are taking them off once again. Both stupid just like shaving ones head in solidarity for the woman going thru chemo. None of those make sense. All I can say to those of us who went through months of chemo, radition, surgeries,  LIGHTEN UP! Boobs, no boobs, bras, no bras, cancer sucks. Why let the actions of others dictate who you are or the way you feel. Just live your life!"
"Triple negative at age 31 diagnosed the week before Christmas.  Christmas is still hard it will be 7 yrs this 12/18.  6 months of chemo, 35 radiation treatments.  Many surgeries.  I love pink or anything with pink ribbons, or breast cancer related.  I feel the support in October when the athletes wear pink.  My daughter included.  Don't take everything so serious.  Remember you were given a second lease on life!"

Help build my project at the same time start your own:

In honor of my late wife Fannilia Celia Richardson, who lost her battle with breast cancer at the young age of 30. I am creating a ""Cancer Awareness Music Theater"" that will have a nationwide impact. An association and national contingency that will  give speeches and performances to highlight and elevate the fight against cancer for national <U+201C>Cancer Awareness<U+201D> For this generation and future generations to come, so that we can be fully prepared and also succeed, in this battle. There are 12 dominant cancers that  are taking us by storm and rapidly killing our wives, mothers, sisters, brothers and fathers, and friends because cancer does not discriminate whether it be age, creed, or race. My vision and Fannilia<U+2019>s Cancer Awareness Theater will make a difference in this world and save many lives.

Please feel free to donate to this amazing project that will do positive deeds and wonders through out the world where Cancer Awareness Is Concern.

P.S: In my 3 decade of my music career after loosing my wife to Breast Cancer on December 10th 2014 my interest is to produce my first music video which is also in honor of my wife Fannilia Celia Bell- Richardson beside the Cancer Awareness Theater I'm in process of raising funds for via We Share Crowd Funding which my composition is: Entitle <U+201C> The Curse Of Cancer <U+201C> which soothe the heart to does that lost someone to cancer.

Please feel free to contribute to this amazing project that is a need for the fight against this deadly epidemic."
"Please read this and consider what you post concerning various breast cancer ""awareness"" events. I am in agreement with her post"
"I agree totally.  I find it offensive to do something that is in poor taste in the name of some cause whether it's breast cancer or something else... I had a mastectomy and went through 16 rounds of chemo and show support by donating to research or organizations that help women and men battling this disease... Wear a pink ribbon but don't degrade something that the rest of us wish we still had if they hadn't tried to kill us"
"I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer last September, multiple surgeries, biopsies chemo and radiation. Reconstruction next summer. I really get mad when people do the walks and buy the cute pink socks etc... Because they don't do the research as to where the money goes. I donate to a local cancer organization that's twenty minutes away but in a different county. For years I contributed and walked. When I needed help financially to cover co pays I was told I wasn't a member of that county so o was ineligible. I started digging into the Susan G. Komen fundraiser and realized the cep has a huge salary. Please do your research as to where the money goes!"
"appreciated this article. I'm into my 4th month of chemo (yes, it is grueling), then surgery, then radiation. All the pink for October sure looks different to me from this vantage point than other years."
"I underwent a needle guided biopsy, infection complications, 4 Lumpectomies, 2 ports in and out, bilateral mastectomy, 2 breast reconstruction, ovaries removed, Chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and lymph edema of my left arm , which I call my Popeye arm because it gets so swollen!! But at the end of the day I'm alive, I'm strong and I AM A SURVIVOR!!!"
"I totally agree! No bra day is ridiculous. I had a mastectomy when I was 24 years old. I've spent the last 20 years dealing with symmetry; spent countless hours trying on hundreds of bras, bathing suits, shirts w/o stripes...trying to look as ""normal"" as possible. No bra day will never happen for me or thousands of women who have actually had breast cancer."
"I've had the no boobs day, one boob for months, can't wear bra's for years day. I'm a 2 time Surviver and sometimes people need to do crazy things to cope with this disease. ( A lot of things don't help like shaving your head when you don't have cancer, wearing pink, wearing no bra falls into this category) If you have been fighting for your life who cares what others do if it makes them feel better!"
"I agree with this. My Mom had breast cancer and a friend is going thru it now. The cutsie and sexualized stuff that has evolved is just nonesense and a bit usensitive. The culture we live in shows up everywhere."
"As a survivor, I understand that cancer is not a game. People have no idea!"
"I have no problem with #NoBraDay,  pink items for sale or any other way folks choose to be aware of breast cancer.  I have survived it!  I would prefer that everyone find a way to support research for a cure in a more direct manner so that funds are not lost to administrative costs, but what really matters is that women get mammograms for early detection.  What really matters is that we fight this horrible disease in all it's terrible variety.  What really matters is that we take care of each other and live to fight and love another day!"
"Double mastectomy,  tram-flap reconstruction,  7 year survivor."
"I am a one year survivor.  Frankly the only reason I would wear anything under my shirt anymore is to hide my misaligned nipples after the lumpectomy.  Otherwise after so many insults to my body with 8 rounds of chemo radiation and surgery I could care less about lingerie.   These women think they are making a statement in solidarity to me are rather misguided."
"I am on my second battle with breast cancer now.  Just finished up with my first reconstruction surgery and I love to see the pink stuff.  I love the games on facebook.  If it gets people talking and thinking about self exams and mammos then it worked.  I know that some charities don't give money like they are supposed to but if a life was saved from early detection because someone didn't wear a bra and remembered to check themselves than that is all that matters to me."
"Ok after some thought ""I spoke to soon"" just gets my temper up a bit I do realize its for awareness , I dont need awareness now.for that type of cancer but the awareness does keep my thoughts for others . Been there done that !! 11 years ago <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0094>~~<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0098>~~<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009D> !
If there hadn't been awareness to do a self breast exam I would not have found my cancer. I think infomation like that is important.Get away from selling pink stuff ""pink is my favorite color""and give information about how to check your self !! Information and Awareness is the key to the first step !<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009E>"
"I would have to agree with the part about taking care of someone locally.  What you donate by buying ""pink"" may or may not ever actually benefit someone.  Sitting with them, taking them to dinner or a movie and treating them like they are normal, dinner, cleaning their house , paying one of their bills, or just hanging out making plans for the future as they kick cancer in the teeth is a good way to support someone.  I never gave it much thought until I was diagnosed after sudden onset symptoms and had a double mastectomy, chemo and reconstruction.  I appreciate all my friends and family who just did every day things with me and took care of me when I needed help.  Including washing my hair before I could lift my arms to do it.  It's those every day things..."
"https://www.change.org/p/u-s-house-of-representatives-help-us-make-october-3rd-inflammatory-breast-cancer-day-2"
"When you envy women who have breasts that aren't cold and scared and still have nipples, the no bra day is just another knife to the heart to what you no longer have, even when you are grateful to still have your life."
"Single mom of four kids and stage III invasive ductal carcinoma SURVIVOR!! I had to have lots of humor for the sake of my kids! This wasn't just my journey; it was all of ours! Happy to say I will be cancer free for 2 years next week! I'm about to graduate from nursing school; so, I can give back to other beautiful fighters as they go through their journey! I will truly be able to say, I know what you are going through and truly mean it!!"
"To all of you telling survivors to ""LIGHTEN UP"" stop attacking survivors for expressing their opinion. There is nothing about this article that says the author is angry. If survivors believe in a more beneficial form of education and raising money for research other than FB games that doesn't make them angry or holding on to anger. As a survivor you should support other survivors not tear them down. Judging and telling women they are holding on to anger or that they need to lighten up is rude. Not everyone holds your opinion and they shouldn't be judged for it. I don't see any you doing anything lbut tearing down women that are sharing their stories and trying to educate people on the other side of breast cancer. Shame on you."
"Well, I don't have cleavage. I have cleave. Not wearing a bra is not an option. Throws your upper back and neck out of alignment I use old bras for sleeping. wear one all the time. enjoy your freedom while you can."
"God bless you all and yous are very inspirational & strong women x<3"
"Combining aspirin and triptolide to prevent lung cancers

Binghui Shen, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Radiation Biology, in collaboration with his physician colleagues Reckamp and Dan Raz, M.D., co-director and surgical director of the Lung Cancer and Thoracic Oncology Program, is studying the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs in preventing lung cancer.

The researchers demonstrated that, when administered separately, aspirin and the drug triptolide (a derivative of a Chinese anti-inflammatory herb known as thunder god vine) each have the effect of moderately suppressing lung cancer development in mice. When combined, however, these two agents reduced the incidence of lung cancer in mice from 70 percent to only 5 percent.

Shen hypothesizes that the drug combination creates an anti-tumor microenvironment and directly kills lung cancer cells by blocking their key survival mechanisms. His new research seeks to increase understanding of how triptolide and aspirin might lower the risk of lung cancer recurrence and eliminate cancer."
"Amen. I'm a survivor too!"
"I don't buy any of that stuff. Very little goes to research. And four top executives at Susan G Koman make 2 million each a year. REALLY!!!!"

Fiets es langs die vrouw die dit nu allemaal doormaakt, bel haar en luister. Meer niet. Dat is solidair zijn. En maak wat over naar het WKF."
"Thank you for saying what we were thinking"
"I was a 20yr breasr cancer survivor. It struck again 4mos ago same breast. Dr suggested another lumpectomy. I Requested Mastectomy. Prayer and your attitude is most important. I thank God for my healing.. I just do mE, and pray for others. Life is too short, to be angry with others. It's their choice. Live your life...."

"God bless you"
"Amen"
"I have been through a double mastectomy 8 rounds of chemo now almost halfway through 28 rounds of radiation with reconstruction next May  and not wearing a bra to support breast cancer is insulting looking at it from a cancer patient and or survivor many other things like cancer walks or wearing pink or getting a mammogram is better at supporting the cause!"

"<U+259D> <U+2599><U+259D> <U+2599> STOP! STOP! STOP! You can't stop cancer with radiation, poison & hypothermia. STOP living in bumble bee land! Cancer is one of countless chronic metabolic diseases (noncommunicable) that have plagued humanity since the beginning. Scurvy, pernicious anemia, pellagra, night blindness are chronic metabolic diseases; all of which are well-known & well-documented vitamin deficits. The preventive, treatment & cure for cancer resides in leafy greens & seeds as these foods contain Amygdalin: a substance that's extraordinarily deadly to cancerous cells. Watch on You-Tube: ""World Without Cancer.""

A woman who's malnourished to the point of cancer is not a soldier. She is not automatically a candidate for sainthood. She is ignorant and ignorance exacts a toll. Surviving a train wreck isn't an act of bravery. Cancer is a measurable, easily explainable, regional, dietary disease. No one is afflicted with cancer as a turn of bad luck, for smoking cigarettes, or for having a cancer-stricken family. What makes regional? Diet. Diets are regional as they are traditional. The missing dietary factor is Amygdalin (vitamin B17).

Ahhh...the blatant hypocrisy and twisted psychology attached to cancer: Young sob-sisters will dutifully shave their heads in sympathetic acknowledgment of the harrowing, yet ""therapeutic,"" radiation-poisoning being suffered by a cancer-plagued friend. Yet, If I were to wear an eye-patch to show my support for a cataract-sufferer, pad my abdomen with pillows during my wife's pregnancy, or fake a limp because a brother recently lost a leg, I'd be deemed an aping fool.

Those who promote Gardasil, pre-emptive amputation of breasts & extirpation of axillary glands, mammography & the 4 accepted cancer ""treatments,"" promote quackery.

The untaxed Komen corporation provides: topflight executives on a mission to drive a world-class, insanely-profitable public relations campaign to propagate an international sorority of cancer-afflicted sob sisters suffering from a naturally-occurring (and thus: a naturally-cured) disease. This disease, known as cancer, is chronic (it persists in spite of the immune system), this disease is metabolic (noncommunicable). Cancer by its nature is a response to the healing process. Damaged tissue requires healing. When the healing process continues beyond its confines a tumorous mass forms to contain these dangerous, misplaced healing cells. Since healing cells are electrostatically negative & the immune system is electrostatically negative and since like-charges repel, the immune system cannot attack cancerous structures. The answer is Amygdalin (known as vitamin B17 or as Laetrile, when synthesized from apricot pips). Vitamin B17 only attacks cancer cells."

"<U+259D> <U+2599><U+259D> <U+2599> STOP! STOP! STOP! You can't stop cancer with radiation, poison & hypothermia. STOP living in bumble bee land! Cancer is one of countless chronic metabolic diseases (noncommunicable) that have plagued humanity since the beginning. Scurvy, pernicious anemia, pellagra, night blindness are chronic metabolic diseases; all of which are well-known & well-documented vitamin deficits. The preventive, treatment & cure for cancer resides in leafy greens & seeds as these foods contain Amygdalin: a substance that's extraordinarily deadly to cancerous cells. Watch on You-Tube: ""World Without Cancer.""

A woman who's malnourished to the point of cancer is not a soldier. She is not automatically a candidate for sainthood. She is ignorant and ignorance exacts a toll. Surviving a train wreck isn't an act of bravery. Cancer is a measurable, easily explainable, regional, dietary disease. No one is afflicted with cancer as a turn of bad luck, for smoking cigarettes, or for having a cancer-stricken family. What makes regional? Diet. Diets are regional as they are traditional. The missing dietary factor is Amygdalin (vitamin B17).

Ahhh...the blatant hypocrisy and twisted psychology attached to cancer: Young sob-sisters will dutifully shave their heads in sympathetic acknowledgment of the harrowing, yet ""therapeutic,"" radiation-poisoning being suffered by a cancer-plagued friend. Yet, If I were to wear an eye-patch to show my support for a cataract-sufferer, pad my abdomen with pillows during my wife's pregnancy, or fake a limp because a brother recently lost a leg, I'd be deemed an aping fool.

Those who promote Gardasil, pre-emptive amputation of breasts & extirpation of axillary glands, mammography & the 4 accepted cancer ""treatments,"" promote quackery.

The untaxed Komen corporation provides: topflight executives on a mission to drive a world-class, insanely-profitable public relations campaign to propagate an international sorority of cancer-afflicted sob sisters suffering from a naturally-occurring (and thus: a naturally-cured) disease. This disease, known as cancer, is chronic (it persists in spite of the immune system), this disease is metabolic (noncommunicable). Cancer by its nature is a response to the healing process. Damaged tissue requires healing. When the healing process continues beyond its confines a tumorous mass forms to contain these dangerous, misplaced healing cells. Since healing cells are electrostatically negative & the immune system is electrostatically negative and since like-charges repel, the immune system cannot attack cancerous structures. The answer is Amygdalin (known as vitamin B17 or as Laetrile, when synthesized from apricot pips). Vitamin B17 only attacks cancer cells."

"I DONATED MY GENOMES TO SCIENCE!

Now we can ALL do more in the fight against breast cancer. There is a new DNA databank created by the geneticists from Columbia University and the New York Genome Center called DNA.Land. DNA.Land is in partnership with the National Breast Cancer Coalition to better understand the genetic risks of breast cancer.

You can contribute to their research if you have access to your genomes. You have access to your genomes if you have ever tested with one of the top three genetic testing companies 23andMe, FamilyTreeDNA or AncestryDNA. If you have already tested then you can start sharing right now, it's FREE! If you haven't tested then please consider doing so. You get to learn what you're made of and get an opportunity to advance cancer research. It's a win win! https://dna.land/"

My vision and Fannilia<U+2019>s Cancer Awareness Theater will make a difference in this world and save many lives.

Please feel free to donate to this amazing project that will do positive deeds and wonders through out the world where Cancer Awareness Is Concern.

P.S: In my 3 decade of my music career after loosing my wife to Breast Cancer on December 10th 2014 my interest is to produce my first music video which is also in honor of my wife Fannilia Celia Bell- Richardson beside the Cancer Awareness Theater I'm in process of raising funds for via We Share Crowd Funding which my composition is: Entitle <U+201C> The Curse Of Cancer <U+201C> which soothe the heart to does that lost someone to cancer.

Antitumor activity of plant cannabinoids with emphasis on the effect of cannabidiol on human breast carcinoma. (2006)
""Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exhibits antitumor effects on various cancer cell types, but its use in chemotherapy is limited by its psychotropic activity. We investigated the antitumor activities of other plant cannabinoids, i.e., cannabidiol, cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabidiol acid and THC acid, and assessed whether there is any advantage in using Cannabis extracts (enriched in either cannabidiol or THC) over pure cannabinoids. Results obtained in a panel of tumor cell lines clearly indicate that, of the five natural compounds tested, cannabidiol is the most potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth (IC(50) between 6.0 and 10.6 microM), with significantly lower potency in noncancer cells.""

"I don't get mammograms because of the radiation, which some believe can actually make you more prone to breast cancer.  There is a technology called thermography which only uses heat and no radiation and may actually be a better tool for diagnosing breast cancer and other health problems.  Because it is not considered the current standard of care, the Insurance companies don't cover the cost. I wish there was more flexibility with insurance policies and more research spent on alternative methods of prevention.  I have had thermography scans done at my chiropractors office. It seems that only the more natural minded doctors offer them."

Help build my project at the same time start your own:

In honor of my late wife Fannilia Celia Richardson, who lost her battle with breast cancer at the young age of 30. I am creating a ""Cancer Awareness Music Theater"" that will have a nationwide impact. An association and national contingency that will  give speeches and performances to highlight and elevate the fight against cancer for national <U+201C>Cancer Awareness<U+201D> For this generation and future generations to come, so that we can be fully prepared and also succeed, in this battle. There are 12 dominant cancers that  are taking us by storm and rapidly killing our wives, mothers, sisters, brothers and fathers, and friends because cancer does not discriminate whether it be age, creed, or race. My vision and Fannilia<U+2019>s Cancer Awareness Theater will make a difference in this world and save many lives.

Please feel free to donate to this amazing project that will do positive deeds and wonders through out the world where Cancer Awareness Is Concern.

P.S: In my 3 decade of my music career after loosing my wife to Breast Cancer on December 10th 2014 my interest is to produce my first music video which is also in honor of my wife Fannilia Celia Bell- Richardson beside the Cancer Awareness Theater I'm in process of raising funds for via We Share Crowd Funding which my composition is: Entitle <U+201C> The Curse Of Cancer <U+201C> which soothe the heart to does that lost someone to cancer.

Please feel free to contribute to this amazing project that is a need for the fight against this deadly epidemic."
"Why are these sites not telling women mammogram causes cancer and chemo will not cure them but actualy kill them ??? Watch the truth about cancer from ty Bollinger on youtube"

"I am a cervical cancer survivor.I am a 2,yes 2,time breast cancer survivor.Cancer returned in the same breast 5 months short of the 5 year mark.No one gave me or my family one cent! We went without,for the 8 years of this horrible disease.My suggestion,give a gas,food,gift card.Directly to a family or family member.Go to the hospital near you or give it to your Dr.to give to a cancer patient! All these cancer walks talks,items sold are nice.But,it COSTS the survivor to participate! i had 7 surgeries in one year.Yes,I had insurance.But,I pay the premium every Month! Cancer is expensive.EARLY DETECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN do! Thank you all for caring.( My hospital and Dr's.we're kind enough to accept payments,each month,I have my word)"

"<U+259D> <U+2599> <U+259A> <U+259B> <U+259C> <U+259F> <U+259E><U+259D> CANCER IS A VITAMIN-DEFICIENCY DISEASE by Richard Thripp: HOW TO CURE IT: DO NOT SUBMIT TO RADIO- & CRYO-ABLATIVE & CHEMO- <U+201C>THERAPIES<U+201D> <U+2014> TAKE PANCREATIC ENZYMES <U+2014> AVOID CERTAIN FOODS & HABITS <U+2014> TAKE VITAMIN B17 (1 to 6 grams daily on a full stomach) AND THE VITAMINS LISTED BELOW <U+2014> EAT THE CARCINOLYTIC FOODS LISTED BELOW <U+2014>

<U+201C>Therapeutic<U+201D> radiation, in any amount, harms living tissue. (Roentgen rays, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, x-radiation, ionizing radiation, corpuscular radiation can be implemented for diagnostic purposes, but never for therapeutic benefit.) Chemo- <U+201C>therapy<U+201D> poisons healthy tissue [necrocytotoxin <U+2013> a toxin that produces death of cells]. Of the 4 protocols in traditional (allopathic) cancer <U+201C>therapy<U+201D>: surgery (cutting), radiation (burning), cryo-ablation/cryosurgery (hypothermia) & chemo/chemical (poisoning/toxifying), only manual surgery possesses some legitimacy when malignant (cancerous) growth has reached a certain stage. It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, pokeberries, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress. A person whose<U+FEFF> diet is deficient in these nitrilosidic foods (those foods rich in Amygdalin, the substance of which the molecularity is 1 part: the natural analgesic<U+FEFF> benzaldehyde, 1 part: hydrogen cyanide, 2 parts: glucose) is incapable of stopping the over-production<U+FEFF> of healing cells<U+FEFF> thus this person has cancer. To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya. Supplement your diet with the nutrients (of which 95% of Americans are chronically deficient) that compliment Laetrile (vitamin B17):  <U+2460> zinc (which is the transport mechanism for Laetrile/vitamin B17) <U+2461> vitamin C (build up to 6 grams a day) <U+2462><U+FEFF> manganese <U+2463> magnesium <U+2464> selenium <U+2465> vitamins B6, B9 & B12 <U+2466> vitamin A <U+2467> vitamin E (at least 2,000 I.U.) 

A cheap, over-the-counter, urine-analysis pregnancy test is accurate in 92% of cases at detecting cancerous cell activity in the body. Men & women can test for cancer upon rising with a pregnancy test as cancer and pre-embryonic cells are virtually indistinguishable (in functionality) from cells designated as: adenocarcinomal, adenocarcinomic, ameboid, anaplastic, angiogenetic, angiogenic, astrocytomal, atypical, basal, blastocystic, cacoethic, cancerial, cancerian, cancerigenic, cancerigenical, cancerogenic, cancerogenical, cancroidal, cankerous, carcinoembryonic, carcinogenic, carcinogenical, carcinoidal, carcinomal, carcinomatoid, carcinomatous, carcinomic, carcinosarcomal, cholangiocarcinomal, dedifferentiated, dysplastic, embryonal, embryonic, embryonical, endometrial, endophytic, epithelial, epitheliomatous, endophytic, exophytic, extra-embryonic, fibroblastic, gestational, glioblastomal, H<U+00FC>rthle, hypermutable, hypermutagenic, leucaemicus, leukaemic, leukaemical, leukemic, leukemical, leukocythemic, leukocytomic, liposarcomal, lymphomal, lymphomic, macroglobulinemiac, malignant, malignantal, malignantic, malignus, melanocytic, melanomatous, melanotic, metastatic, metastatical, M<U+00FC>llerian, mutagenic, mutagenical, mutated, mutational, mycoplasmal, mycoplasmic, myelodysplastic, myelodysplastical, myelomal, myelomatoid, myelomonocytic, myelomonocytical, myeloproliferative, myxoid, myxoidic, necrogenic, necrogenous, neo-blastic, neo-embryonic, neo-fetal, neo-formative, neo-genetic, neo-genetical, neo-plasiac, neo-plasmic, neo-plastic, neo-plastigenic, odontogenic, oncogenic, oncologic, oncological, osteosarcomal, paraneoplastic, paraneoplastical, paraneoplastical, pathogenetic, pathogenetical, pathogenic, pathogenical, placental, placentational, pleiomorphic, pleomorphic, polymorphic, polymorphical, pluripotent, pre-cancerous, pre-embryonal, pre-leukemic, promyelocytic, promyelocytical, proto-embryonic, proto-leukemic, pre-squamous, proto-oncogenetic (gene), proto-tumorous, quasi-neoplastic, sarcomal, sarcomatous, squamous, toxicogenic, toxicogenomic, trophic, trophical, trophoblastic, trophoblastical, trophoplasmatic, trophoplasmic, tumefactive, tumefied, tumid, tumoral, tumorigenic, tumorlike, tumorous. Watch (available on You-Tube) G. Edward Griffin's ""World Without Cancer.""

IN BRIEF Concerning Cancer: 1. Take a pregnancy test just after waking up. For men a positive result means either cancer or a false positive. Take another test the next day. If a man gets 3 positive results then likely he has cancer somewhere. For women a positive result means (if she's able to become pregnant) she's pregnant or she has cancer, or she's pregnant and she has cancer, or a false positive (the test result is wrong). 

2. Several positive pregnancy test results = cancer. What next? STOP eating red meat, sugar, corn syrup. STOP drinking booze. STOP (or at least cut back on) smoking.

3. Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. Take vitamin B17 (at least 1 gram daily) and wheat grass and/or barley grass liquid or capsules (they're rich in vitamin B17), on a full stomach daily (you can't overdose on them ~ they're not poisonous). Take a zinc supplement. Take pancreatic enzymes.  

Since 2009 I have ordered vitamin B17 from Metabolic Products in California. 500 m.g. costs 87 cents. My mother is 80. She's been taking a gram per day for a year. Her pregnancy tests were positive in June 2013. They're negative now. I told her that she could cut her daily dose of vitamin B17 from 1,000 m.g. to 100 m.g. now that she's cancer-free but she insists on taking the high dose as it's made her fingernails harder and her hair thicker.

REVIEW: TAKE pregnancy tests to detect cancer. TAKE vitamin B17 (and as many of the listed vitamins as you can, especially zinc). Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. STOP eating red meat & cane sugar. It will take several weeks on B17 therapy to turn out negative pregnancy test results. The tumor WILL NOT shrink much even after the cancer is gone because only 10% of the tumor was cancer. The tumor MAY swell temporarily as the vitamin B17 kills malignant cells.

NOTE: Vitamin B17 therapy WILL NOT destroy the tumor! Vitamin B17 therapy will destroy the malignant cells (cancerous cells) of the tumor and within the tumor. Only 5% to 10% of the cells comprising a tumor are cancerous cells. In time the tumorous growth will be absorbed, in whole or in part. Unless the tumor is cosmetically displeasing, impinging nerves or blood vessels or hampering normal bodily function then let it be.

Divide and conquer is a precept of war. There are now hundreds of ""cancers."" Treatment strategies are customized & personalized.

"The new mammogram guidelines is ridiculous. Due to the high cancer rate in my family I get one every year. No one is going to tell me when to get exams for anything. If you wait until you are 45 years old, it may be too late. Women should get a yearly mammogram & gyn exam as a preventative measure. Shame on the American Cancer Society and the insurance companies!"
"And remember not ALL Breast Cancer is found during a Mammogram.
Please learn about Inflammatory Breast Cancer ~
http://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/ibc-fact-sheet"
"So agree with her....I am a nurse and have cared for young women with breast cancer....as women , we are now told when we can and can't have our pap tests, now when to have mammograms, drs. don't have to do breast exams with yearly check-ups.....SAD!, We are on our own....."
"I was diagnosed at 26! Because my husband found a lump. And I had to kick and scream to get a mammogram.  With no family history. It has been 9 years and I have been cancer free. Im still undergoing reconstruction to this day."
"This recommendation by the ASC is disastrous! It's a giant step backward in women's breast health and cancer diagnosis. As a breast cancer survivor, thank you Ms Robach for your advocacy about this extremely important issue."
"I had been getting mammograms since I was in my early thirties, when they discovered a spot on my right breast.  The place could not be felt and was a fast growing cancer   Had I waited, my life would have been drastically changed  As it was I had to endure a total mastectomy and I have now been cancer free for 20 years. The idea that mammograms can be put off if ludicrous. No one in my family ever had breast cancer   It has to start with someone and I pray that it is NOT YOU!!!!!"
"Get your Mammogram !!!!"
"It should also be noted that women over 80 are being told they don't need mammograms.  My mother died at 88 of cancer that started in her breast.  NO 80 year old breast cancer surviver should die of breast cancer just because someone thinks they no longer need a mammogram in their 80's."
"My mother was diagnosed with advanced Breast Cancer in her 40's and passed away at the age of 50. I do not agree with changing the age for mammograms.   The earlier a cancer is found  the better chance you have of surviving"
"I totally agree! Having been diagnosed at age 43 with stage 2 BC, we found it was also in the lymph nodes. Had I waited longer it would have been far more advanced and more difficult chemo regimen. These new guidelines are ridiculous."

"Considering I had a clear mammogram in April, the day after my diagnostic mammogram there was a huge lump which is now my cancer. I think they are figuring out how harmful mammograms are."
"The new recommendations are ridiculous.  I started my mammograms at age 35 because if family history and had one every year except for 2 years when I was pregnant and breastfeeding.  Because I knew my body so well U felt the huge lump agile breastfeeding and immediately insisted on a mammogram and thankfully my breast surgeon did a biopsy and at the age of 38 I was diagnosed with stage 3a Breast cancer DCIS ironically in my dycts. My daughter saved my life and me knowing my body so well. Ladies keep fighting or get your mammograms ans biopsies as early as age 30."
"Totally agree! The MEN making these decisions need not get their prostates checked until 60 then????
I'm 47. I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer 10 months ago. On a routine mammogram, that I've had since I was 35, bc of family history.
ROUTINE MAMMOGRAM SINCE I WAS 35. Thank God for my Doctors!"

"Mine was found at age 40 on my 1st mammogram.  The oncologist told me it saved my life.  I am angry and sad."
"Totally agree! I was diagnosed at 44 w/ VERY aggressive triple negative breast cancer! No family history- if I had waited I would be dead....bottom line! Women will die because of this recommendation!!"
"I was 27 when my mammogram found my cancer. That's when I lost my breast and started my journey.  I'm now 57. Breast cancer doesn't even run in my family."
"I think it is bullshit they changed the age. My niece had just turned 30 and had I believe stage 3 or 4 breast cancer. There is no history of it in our family. I have read about a lot of young women with breast cancer. So now they want to say get them later. I would like to know what kind of drugs these people are on. A pure dumbass move."
"I had breast cancer in 2009 and I agree with you 100 percent"
"I work at a large cancer center and work for breast oncologist. She also disagrees with the recommendations. And as much as she disagrees with a later start, she's even more concerned about the 2 years between rather than one. Time is always the enemy with a cancer diagnosis."
"Wrong in so many ways - delayed mammograms, then the older population ASC identifies as more likely to get cancer are told not to get a mammogram every year, then doctors are told there is no need to to manual breast exams??? What happened to early detection saving lives? My daughter would  be dead if her doctor had follow these ""guidelines."""
"These guidelines generalize women as statistics! This is an individual disease!! Women and their doctors should be first with healthcare! Not the other way around!!"

"I totally agree....my doctor told me I didn't need a mammogram when I was 49 because I had no history and was still in my 40's however at 50 I was diagnosed with lobular and ductal cancer early stage and had to have a bilateral and to this day I am bitter because just maybe....if I had it at 49 it would have been caught then...who knows but I still to this day remind the Dr of his guide lines that they are not the best for everyone...I should have insisted since in my early 40's I was diagnosed with colon cancer and had to fight with my primary dr to get a ""referral"" after a test showed blood in my stool  PLEASE no matter what age you are stand up for yourself no one knows your body like you and how you are feeling!!"
"I too was diagnosed this year with no family history. Mammogram caught it early."
"Angry is what all women should be. I wouldn't  be here today if I listen to this .  I was 43 when I had my mastectomy"
"Amen, Amy Robach!!!!"
"I had a clear mammogram a year ago in September. Five months later I found a lump in a self-exam. It was stage 2 non-invasive. I have gone through chemo and radiation and found that I am positive for the BRCA2 gene and am going in for surgery tomorrow to have my ovaries removed. I'm 61 and have had mammograms since I was 40. They are extremely important but so is self-exams. Always be aggressive with your own health."
"I was 35 when I found my lump and 36 when I had my first mammogram. Grade 3 stage 2a invasive ductal carcinoma and DCIS. I think every woman should have a mammogram at 35."
"Early detection with a 3D mammogram saved me.  Many women will die due to these new recommendations.  We are not statistics!"
"I love and respect you so much, @AmyRobach! I just recently asked my doctor for a mammogram and colonoscopy and he flat out said, ""No, you are too young!"" I am 37- years old, and both my grandmothers are survivors of colon cancer and lymphoma. Sadly, I lost my hero and my world...my dad, two years ago to stage 4 esophageal cancer. I have cancer on both sides of my family, having lost four uncles and my father to cancer, and doctor denied my wish for these tests. Now, I will seek a new family physician and battle the insurance because they do not want to pay for these tests unless there is cause....and I'm not of recommended age. Ridiculous! I will not give up until I am treated, and know everything will be alright! Keep on fighting and you're always in my prayers. May God bless you, always."
"I had my first mammogram at 40 within 2 weeks I was having ultrasound, biopsy and surgery. Thank God mine was calcium deposits but left undiagnosed it could have been much worse."
"I think it should depend on Family history or if you find a lump at whatever age...If there's no problem, then you should wait until you're 40...I started when I was 45...Eight years ago a very small lump was discovered...It was  removed and benign...After that, I've had a mammogram/ultra sound every year...Just went for one Tuesday and got results Wednesday...All is clear...I won't mind every other year...But high risk should every year...."
"Please get a mammogram as early as you can.  If I didnt go yearly my stage 0 would never have been found.  And for those who say stage 0 is precancerous or noninvasive I say thank god I had bilateral matestomies.  My pathology in one breast was positive in 8/11 of the slides.  If I waited another 6mo or a year I might be at stage 1-2.  I am also fighting to be my own advocate as I had a positive margin after mastectomy:  my doctor just took more tissue samples near my positive margin at the tome of my second stage reconstruction.  So im waitingnow for the results.  I also had no family history.  I had a baseline mammo at age 35 years ago."
"I was diagnosed at 27 four years ago. Insurance did not fight me or my doctor. I had a mammogram, ultra sound and biopsy all in the same day. I'm lucky and blessed and I understand my experience was quite rare. I can't understand for the life of me why that right is being taken away from people. It's not fair. They say early detection is key, yet early detection methods are being taken away from us? I'm disgusted and heartbroken over these regulations."
"Getting worse all the time! I mean dose the US really want to find a cure for cancer? Lots of money involved here!"
"Totally agree with her--new guidelines are ridiculous!"
"I was diagnosed at 42  it had spread to my lymph nodes. I may not be here today with these new guides."
"I am so angry with this. I would very likely be dead. By the time I was 42 I had been diagnosed x2 once in each boob with different markers and types. This is going the wrong way. What big pharma got involved?"
"BRAVO!!!!"
"No!!!!!!  The guidelines should NOT have changed!  UNREAL!  
Ladies follow the old guidelines!"
"The new guidelines could have left me dead."
"I was diagnosed at age 35, 39 and 44. I would not be around if I listened to the 40 recommendation. FYI I have no history."
"I was diagnosed at Age 42 on one side and age 43 on the other early stage. If I went by these guide lines, where would I be now."
"It's maddening!!!! I was diagnosed at 39! With absolutely no family history. Just completed my treatments and surgeries and don't know what kind of outcome I would have had if I had waited."
"Well said..."
"Instead of prevention, it sounds like the healthcare system wants to make more and more money. This is going backwards! If I had waited until I was 50 to have a mammogram I would not be here today!"
"I'm with her! I've had breast problems since I was 17yrs old, I'm now 51, I'd love to know who makes these ""guidelines?"" Ladies I recommend DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THEM!!! Do whatever it takes to stay heathy, pay attention to your own body & intuition!! EARLY DETECTION IS KEY! Screw these guidelines!! Stay aware of yourself!!! Can't stress enough!

"Agreed! My first mammo showed bc. I had a successful treatment and outcome. Waiting till 45, it would have been much worse."
"You are absolutely right!!!!!!"
"I agree. I was first diagnosed at the age of 29 and again at 30 with no family history."
"It's garbage.  Women aren't statistics.  I'll continue with yearly and personal breast exams and mammograms.  I've been doing this since I was 30.  At 56, I'm not changing my routine.  Too many suffer and too many lives lost."
"I was stage 2 at age 42. No history. I'm outraged that they would change this!!!!"
"It's crazy!  I would not be here today if I had waited till I was 40 much less any later!"
"I agree with Amy and her concern about Insurance Companies not paying for the testing for those that want it earlier than the determined recommendation."
"I had one in February and in july i found the lump that is how fast cancer comes the number 1 thing to do is check your self but i agree everyone should have it every year"
"i dont want crackpots telling me or anyone how to care for themselves! check yourself monthly get your ob/gyn to do regular exams and get mammograms yrly"

"Heavy metals and breast cancer:
The prominence of estrogens in the etiology of breast cancer has lead to the suggestion that exposure to environmental estrogens may increase the risk of developing the disease. Metall Oestrogens are small ionic metals and metalloids that include metal/metalloid anions and divalent cations, such as cadmium, calcium, cobalt, copper, nickel, chromium, lead, mercury, and tin. Because metallic estrogens activate the estrogen receptor in the absence of estradiol, exposure to these metals may increase the risk of developing breast cancer.

"Beautiful couple"
"Unfortunately ALOT of marriages have been broken from cancer. True test of vows"

"Warmed my heart."
"Good for them."
"Loved her book!"
"ALL CANCER MATTER!"
"I am having both of mine removed in December.......BRCA 1 positive, stage 1 breast cancer, age 37."
"I had stage 3B in left breast and opted for radical bi lateral mastectomies . Just didn't have the stamina to worry about the ca free breast and the possibility of having to face treatment of breast ca once again ( 8 months of chemo, 32 radiation treatments  and another surgery ) Peace of mind was worth loosing both breasts and I would do it again without hesitation ..."
"I'm reading this exactly a year since my diagnosis - I was encouraged to have a double mastectomy 2 weeks after finding out I had breast cancer - I was in shock and having to decide - I understood I had to have the breast removed that had cancer but why the other one if nothing was wrong with it - it was the hardest decision of my life and I dwelled on it seeking onions and craved to speak to other ladies who had been in the same position - I actually ended up going with s different surgeon (for other reasons) and she said to just deal with the one at the moment as it is twice the operation, twice the risk of infection and that I could always have the other breast off later like at reconstruction time ... I deliberated and chose to do the double but I backed out of that decision the day before the operation / I just couldn't bear not having a breast or nipple so I just had the one breast removed.  A year later I feel comfortable with my decision - had a mammogram and ultrasound yesterday - all seems good with my remaining breast (thus far).  Still eats my mind and waiting to know when I can have reconstruction as then I will also have to decide all over again whether to keep the good breast still."
"Had a bilateral mastectomy and never looked back. Best thing I ever did."
"Having a bilateral mastectomy doesn't necessarily mean that you are free of reoccurrence....I learnt that the hard way! 14mths post bilateral and chemo I have BC mets in the liver....."
"I too, opted for the bilateral mastectomy.  God Bless You...you are here!!!"
"I opted for a double mastectomy- even after the surgeon offered to attempt a lumpectomy.  I am soooo glad to have made that decision.  I don't miss my heavy breasts - and I certainly don't miss the concern and worry of a recurrence!!"
"I made the decision at 31 to have a bilateral mastectomy done. The best decision I made concerning my health, all why being a single mom to two handsome young boys. I have never looked back. I took the 5 year Lupron shot  and am now one year out and doing well. God bless any one going through cancer and best wishes"
"It scares me so much to hear how many women under the recommended age for starting mammograms have breast cancer.  I'll be 30 in April, I do a self-exam every 6 weeks, have my annual gynocogical exam every year, but I still feel like I should do more.  I wish I could start mammograms this year, but I know it would be prohibitively expensive.

To all of you who are fighting or are survivors, my heart goes out to you.  You are so brave, and so beautiful!"
"I had a bilateral mastectomy in June. I am a stage 2b also.  I'm glad I did.  Still have reconstruction ahead of me. I found that having both of them removed didn't bother me as much as I anticipated  it would."
"I was lucky just a lumpectomy in 2012, but I'm stressing out while awaiting results of a biopsy of the skull bone my appointment is on Monday waiting to exhale."
"I asked whether to have my other healthy breast removed and was advised not to. Post-op, i found it difficult to find reasonably priced, beautiful pocketed bras and swimwear, so decided to start selling them myself. If you are in the same position, or know somebody who is, check out my website - www.taraswimwear.co.nz. Having gorgeous underwear has helped me accept my situation and I love being able to help other women. Kia kaha - stay strong"
"I too have one breast now and every day wish I had taken them both...everyday as I dress I feel like such a freak the fake boob is hot it's heavy and sometimes rubs me the wrong way lol my kids say that I should be happy I am alive, and I am but if I had to make the decision again both would be gone!!! Stay strong everyone xo"
"People we should fight against cancer"
"Another women under the Am Cancer Society's new guidelines - 31 well under the 45 yrs old they recommended."
"Each to their own but for peace of mind ,both were my option too. Wanted the rest of my life with the people i love not returning to fight again . All the luck in the world to those going through it today x"
"OMG! Reading your story was like looking at my own life.  From the feelings of having one breast to the time frame it took me to remove the healthy one! My thoughts and feelings are exactly the same as yours!"
"I totally agree! !! Wish I would have done that to."

"At least Facebook reinstated the photo. It should have never been reported in the first place, however. If someone can show their butt hanging out of their pants/bikini/etc and boobs busting out of their top (if they even have one on that is) then breastfeeding women have a right to post the magical moments of feeding their nursling."
"I wouldn't mind at all. It's a beautiful photo. I'm so pleased that Emma was able to breast feed her baby."
"She's not all dress up provocatively ,she's just doing a normal feeding of her baby. I have nothing against this photo! It's the people who want to send shocking provoking photos out of breastfeeding dressed and made up like they are not naturally everyday. I call them the bombshell breast feeders! Let's keep breastfeeding a natural thing it's not for Letterio de Lucast or shock value it's life!"
"I can see how people might be upset because you can see the areola and tiny bit of the nipple so close up, but as a mother of a premie who couldn't breastfeed right away either, I think it's adorable and it shows just how tiny this precious baby really is."
"A beautiful picture, makes me realise how much I miss breastfeeding."
"I wouldn't mind at all the mum and baby are beautiful"
"How ever..about this picture,   She is as Mom (Mother ) take a lot of time to bereadtfeeding her child, 
I appreciate her for the struggle had a pregnant,  
gave breast feeding, 
take a bath the baby, 
teaching the baby, 
and grow up, 
I can't imagine how strong she is..."
"This photo does not bother me. I seen worst photos on FB that does not involve breastfeeding, those are the ones people should get all hot & bothered about!"
"Would not bother me,  it's a natural way to feed your baby."
"I have seen penises, side breasts, and much more provacative photos than a woman feeding her baby."
"Breast feeding is a normal beautiful process between mother and child and creates a wonderful bond.  I can't see why people get upset about it.  There are far worse images and other crap to complain about on the tinterweb and in life.  Folk should get a grip."
"Lovely photo of you and your beautiful baby."
"100% no I say 60% of the USA was feed this way so if anyone have a problem with this and any women/mother feeding there baby shouldn't have children i e child use the microwave"
"I don't mind at all. Breastfed my three children for a year."
"breast feeding is a natural, wholesome wonderful experience and it should be celebrated!"
"Breast feeding is natural and beautiful."
"I mean they're her photo's, they don't really matter to the public, I'm not sure why you would even have a photo of your child open to the public on your profile. People generally report photos for their own satisfaction anyway, it doesn't really offend them."
"Yes.. Why do I want to see a woman breast feeding her child on my newsfeed?? There is no reason what so ever to post it for the world to see!!"
"Breastfeeding is.natural. it would.not bother me."
"Why r people so bothered by this pic. This is normal for breastfeeding."
"I don't mind , I breastfed my 3 children."
"For the love of God there are more important things to worry about in this day and age than a mother feeding her precious baby in the most natural way possible.  Why does everyone have to be so sensitive and easily offended??  Get over it people and get a damn life so maybe you will stop worrying about everyone else's. ..geeez!!!"
"Nudity is nudity. Whether it's a glimpse of nipple and/or areola during breastfeeding or exposure of nipple and/or areola on a woman in a sexualized manner. Neither should be on Facebook."
"I've seen lots of offensive things on Facebook, and this is NOT one of them! Prayers for this Mother and her Baby!"
"This is why God invented women's breasts!"
"No problem at all. Funny how ""this"" offends but Kardashians showing every nook and cranny is OK???  How."
"what a precious moment in time.  What a shame people can't what human babies eat without getting their knickers in a twist."
"Come on, This! Is! Life! and the best she could do for her premature baby.        I wish you a happy and healthy life."
"Why does anyone mind seeing a naked breast? It's exactly the same as a naked arm or leg. IT'S SKIN!! Get over the ""taboo"" of a naked breast. Let a mom be a mom anywhere she wants to."
"I have no problem with this or the actual photo. This is a mother doing what God intended!"
"There is a difference, she is properly clothed not but naked taking a selfie."
"Its a beautiful sight.  More power to her."
"I'd rather see precious moments like this 100x a day rather then 1/2 the stuff I do see! Where's the outrage and disgust over all the fighting videos and sexually explicit crap! If I don't like what a fb friend is posting I either ""unfriend"" them or unfollow their post! Plan & simple."
"Omg honestly people do what you want with your kids this shit is getting annoying have respect for one another and I don't think its so much people dont wanna see it. They just dont think girls should whip there boobs out in a public place do you every think maybe other parents just don't want there child seeing a woman breast.Than when this shit happens it goes on about but its okay for other woman just grow the f up as a woman im tired of hearing about this crap.Im sure people are also getting tired of being called perverts when it as nothing to do about that its just called respect and breast feeding is normal but when you take your bare breast out in front of a bunch of people its different people are going to have different things to say its called life."
"So beautiful and oh so important!"
"Wouldn't mind at all"
"This is the most natural way of feeding babies!! Nothing wrong with this at all unless your a weird pervert<U+2026>......"
"No, wouldn't bother me"
"Nope I don't mind"
"Some people just need to get a life."
"Not at all"
"There us nothing wrong with this , as it is a natural an beautiful to see , well done sweetie and in happy for you and your family to have this lovely bundle of joy in your lives"
"No, it is sweet<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0080>. I get why this would be an exciting event, worthy of a fb post.  Likewise, there are posts of newborns being embraced by their moms wearing hospital robes that reveal just as much."
"Doesn't bother me at all, actually it shows me that how ignorant other people are,  Glad their baby has made this milestone,  God Bless, and to all the haters, ,quit hating!!!!"
"I have no problem with it."
"Nope"
"Is it against the law? Is it breaking the law?"
"Nooooooooo"
"I remember every single one of them <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00B1>. What were we thinking?"
"I mostly agree with this except I didn't like when people said, ""oh, you look great."" First, I knew I didn't look great, and second, it made me want to scream, ""I don't care what I look like,  I FEEL horrible, and I need you to acknowledge that!"" I guess everyone is just different in how they cope."
"My mother is currently fighting stage 4 breast cancer and I've learned that all she really wants is to have someone by her side. No matter if you're just laying there, the fact that she has someone to talk to and feel like she has a purpose makes her strong. All cancer patients want is physical and emotional support. That doesn't mean you tell them constantly it's gonna be okay, or tell them how great they look, they don't care about that. They just need to know you're there for them."
"""It's going to be okay"" is received as ""Yeah, sure; it's gonna be okay for YOU."""
"Yep... I cringed when someone would say "" it's gonna be okay""..."
"So true!!!!"
"I am the opposite, when someone would say it's going to be ok...this gave me more positivity to keep on going and helped me stay positive.  Sure my daughter, son  and husband were not physically experiencing what I was going through, but emotionally they were there every step of the way, tell me ""it's going to be ok you got this, we got this.""   Total strangers would give me that encouragement almost daily and I am so thankful for them.  I only wish I could have the guts to throw those encouraging words to survivors as they go through the struggle of and for their life.  I found myself getting angry with other survivors as they were going or had gone through, telling me ""well I never had that happen you need to relax"" or ""my oncologists told me to take this or do this I would change oncologists, you should go to mine""."

"Yes, our friend had a daughter who at 3rd  yrs old said ""no more mommy"" after suffering from brain cancer. Poor baby went on her journey to be with God. May she rest in peace."
"Definitely, they are wise beyond their years, accepting, faithful. Their hearts are truly in the right place. Prayers for this family"
"so sad"
"Did you see that poor child? Who wants to live like that? So sad."
"Yes... much better than an adult would"
"Children have more clarification and understanding than given credit for."
"If we could be child like that is when you can understand. God Bless her!"
"I get it. Sometimes the ""cure"" is worse than the alternative."
"Yes."

"Amazing story"
"amazing lady"

"While I understand what this mom was attempting to say, it does come across as aggressive.  First of all, the ""yelling capitals"" should go... it automatically makes the reader assume a defensive mental stance.  Also, if she had phrased her concern in a less ""you other parents are bad, you're doing Halloween wrong, stop it now"" way, it probably would be better received.  Something along these lines would sit better with me:  ""Halloween is one of the most fun and exciting holidays for children, but it can also be a time where some children feel left out.  For children with food allergies and other medical limitations, it can be very disheartening to not have treats that they can enjoy.  To make it possible for all of our children to be in on the fun, please consider either offering treats that don't contain common allergens (nuts, gluten, or dairy) or offer an alternative for kids with allergies.  In addition to the safe candies I've listed below, other fun treat ideas are stickers, pencils, glow sticks, and other festive non-food items.  Thank you for your consideration!""  See how much less insulting, condescending, and demanding that sounds?"
"Handing candy out is NOT something that people have to do. If your child has allergies, go through their candy (as you should be doing anyways) and take out the things they can't have. Simple as that!!!"
"I'm sorry-this is ridiculous. I ditto every comment about checking your child's candy/responsible parenting. Also, teach your kids to take care of themselves. Kids with allergies should know what they can and can't eat. If they don't, it's a trip to the hospital. Allergies suck, but for every kid with allergies there's tons without. Halloween is a charitable holiday and no one should dictate what others choose to give out."
"This letter is very combative. While most people sympathize with those with allergies, it's the parent of the child responsibility to ensure the child gets the candy he/she can have. Most people buy bags of mixed candy- and in those bags contain things these kids are allergic to. And most people aren't going to to deviate from that to accommodate a few kids.
She could have her kid trick or treat and be happy, keep candy at home that her child CAN eat, and give away the candy collected that the child can't eat. 
Her letter was aggressive and puts people on the defensive."
"Too aggressive! If you are so worried about allergies you don't put your child in that situation. You let them go out, have fun and go buy them something that is safe for them. You and your child should know by now what's safe and what isn't. You should be checking their food all the time anyway! Don't expect the neighborhood thats been doing the same thing for years to change just for one person."
"NO"
"So by ""don't leave any children out of the fun"" she is disappointing every child without allergies when they get home to discover their bags full of carrots and raisins. I really hate these SJW's thinking everyone is entitled to do what they want. Natural selection would have dealt with her a long time ago."
"Parents are responsible for their children's health not the community."
"Guess what  I have  food allergy to anything with eggs or  food dies  leaves out pretty. Much everything   I am pretty happy that I found other things to make me fat.."
"You teach your child to deal with their allergies you do know expect the whole world to change for them. I have relatives with nut allergies and they do just fine avoiding nuts without expecting special treatment. Same as someone saying they are Jewish so their school can't have a Christmas party. People need to adapt and not expect special treatment."

"If it's just for symmetry then a reconstruction at same time of removal is the go. Walk in with 2 boobs,  walk out with 2 boobs, that's what I told my surgeon anyway, boobless was not an option and never should be"
"I choose and fought for a bilateral mastectomy, my surgeon did not want to remove the healthy breast and I told him ""you do it or I will find another Docter that will"", he agreed, there was no reconstruction and his proudest moment was when he told me he saved my tattoes...I am 14 years since that day and never looked back.."
"I have the exact same story, I mean I thought someone was writing about me. I had the VA hospital do a lumpectomy. They had promised before the surgery that I would have reconstruction. I have been fighting the VA for 5 1/2 years. Each time I went to a different doctor I was told it was about vanity, and plastic, not required surgery. I have one Brest barely a C cup on one side an E on the other. 
Finally  2days ago my implants were drained. For the first stage of reconstruction.  Buti ithas been forever until I had xrays done my back and neck are so bad that I had them drained during my first appointment just to relieve the wight"

"I opted to have both removed 11 years ago.   I'm so glad I did."

"<U+272A><U+272A><U+272A> CANCER IS A VITAMIN-DEFICIENCY DISEASE by Richard Thripp: HOW TO CURE IT: DO NOT SUBMIT TO RADIO- & CRYO-ABLATIVE & CHEMO- <U+201C>THERAPIES<U+201D> <U+2014> TAKE PANCREATIC ENZYMES <U+2014> AVOID CERTAIN FOODS & HABITS <U+2014> TAKE VITAMIN B17 (1 to 6 grams daily on a full stomach) AND THE VITAMINS LISTED BELOW <U+2014> EAT THE CARCINOLYTIC FOODS LISTED BELOW <U+2014>

<U+201C>Therapeutic<U+201D> radiation, in any amount, harms living tissue. (Roentgen rays, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, x-radiation, ionizing radiation, corpuscular radiation can be implemented for diagnostic purposes, but never for therapeutic benefit.) Chemo- <U+201C>therapy<U+201D> poisons healthy tissue [necrocytotoxin <U+2013> a toxin that produces death of cells]. Of the 4 protocols in traditional (allopathic) cancer <U+201C>therapy<U+201D>: surgery (cutting), radiation (burning), cryo-ablation/cryosurgery (hypothermia) & chemo/chemical (poisoning/toxifying), only manual surgery possesses some legitimacy when malignant (cancerous) growth has reached a certain stage. It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, pokeberries, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress. A person whose<U+FEFF> diet is deficient in these nitrilosidic foods (those foods rich in Amygdalin, the substance of which the molecularity is 1 part: the natural analgesic<U+FEFF> benzaldehyde, 1 part: hydrogen cyanide, 2 parts: glucose) is incapable of stopping the over-production<U+FEFF> of healing cells<U+FEFF> thus this person has cancer. To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya.

IN BRIEF Concerning Cancer: 1. Take a pregnancy test just after waking up. For men a positive result means either cancer or a false positive. Take another test the next day. If a man gets 3 positive results then likely he has cancer somewhere. For women a positive result means (if she's able to become pregnant) she's pregnant or she has cancer, or she's pregnant and she has cancer, or a false positive (the test result is wrong). 

2. Several positive pregnancy test results = cancer. What next? STOP eating red meat, sugar, corn syrup. STOP drinking booze. STOP (or at least cut back on) smoking.

3. Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. Take vitamin B17 (at least 1 gram daily) and wheat grass and/or barley grass liquid or capsules (they're rich in vitamin B17), on a full stomach daily (you can't overdose on them ~ they're not poisonous). Take a zinc supplement. Take pancreatic enzymes.  

Since 2009 I have ordered vitamin B17 from Metabolic Products in California. 500 m.g. costs 87 cents. My mother is 80. She's been taking a gram per day for a year. Her pregnancy tests were positive in June 2013. They're negative now. I told her that she could cut her daily dose of vitamin B17 from 1,000 m.g. to 100 m.g. now that she's cancer-free but she insists on taking the high dose as it's made her fingernails harder and her hair thicker.

REVIEW: TAKE pregnancy tests to detect cancer. TAKE vitamin B17 (and as many of the listed vitamins as you can, especially zinc). Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. STOP eating red meat & cane sugar. It will take several weeks on B17 therapy to turn out negative pregnancy test results. The tumor WILL NOT shrink much even after the cancer is gone because only 10% of the tumor was cancer. The tumor MAY swell temporarily as the vitamin B17 kills malignant cells.

NOTE: Vitamin B17 therapy WILL NOT destroy the tumor! Vitamin B17 therapy will destroy the malignant cells (cancerous cells) of the tumor and within the tumor. Only 5% to 10% of the cells comprising a tumor are cancerous cells. In time the tumorous growth will be absorbed, in whole or in part. Unless the tumor is cosmetically displeasing, impinging nerves or blood vessels or hampering normal bodily function then let it be.

"<U+259D> <U+2599> <U+259D> <U+2599> The preventative, treatment & cure for insomnia and mental illnesses (including the diseases: anorexia & pellagra)<U+FEFF> is niacin (vit. B3). Research Dr. Abram Hoffer. Anorexia is a vitamin-deficiency disease. Psychological counseling is as effective w/anorexia as it is w/scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) or cancer/sickle-cell anemia/hypertension (vit. B17 deficiency). You can't talk, or reason, someone out of a chronic metabolic ailment<U+FEFF> anymore than you can slake a person's thirst by ruminating over their traumatic childhood. Anorexia is a sub-clinical symptom of the vitamin-deficiency disease pellagra. The preventative, treatment & cure is vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Niacin causes a false histamine reaction (prickly, red skin) that's harmless. You can build up a tolerance to niacin or take flush-free niacin. ALL who suffer from anorexia nervosa are deficient in the water-soluble vitamin B3. There is no known toxicity for B3. You won't O.D. on it. Excessive B3 ends up in the urine. Cancer is a disease of deficiency as is thirst & starvation. W/o water we die, no amt. of praying can change that fact of course as the Lord provides, thru His bounty, those things we need to survive. Indeed, Scripture stresses the importance of consuming seeds: ""Give us this day our daily bread,"" was written at a time<U+FEFF> when bread contained whole, raw seeds--seeds abounding in cancer-killing Amygdalin. <U+2013> Richard Thripp <U+259D> <U+2599><U+259D> <U+2599>"

<U+201C>Therapeutic<U+201D> radiation, in any amount, harms living tissue. (Roentgen rays, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, x-radiation, ionizing radiation, corpuscular radiation can be implemented for diagnostic purposes, but never for therapeutic benefit.) Chemo- <U+201C>therapy<U+201D> poisons healthy tissue [necrocytotoxin <U+2013> a toxin that produces death of cells]. Of the 4 protocols in traditional (allopathic) cancer <U+201C>therapy<U+201D>: surgery (cutting), radiation (burning), cryo-ablation/cryosurgery (hypothermia) & chemo/chemical (poisoning/toxifying), only manual surgery possesses some legitimacy when malignant (cancerous) growth has reached a certain stage. It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, pokeberries, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress. 
   A person whose<U+FEFF> diet is deficient in these nitrilosidic foods (those foods rich in Amygdalin, the substance of which the molecularity is 1 part: the natural analgesic<U+FEFF> benzaldehyde, 1 part: hydrogen cyanide, 2 parts: glucose) is incapable of stopping the over-production<U+FEFF> of healing cells<U+FEFF> thus this person has cancer. To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya. Supplement your diet with the nutrients (of which 95% of Americans are chronically deficient) that compliment Laetrile (vitamin B17):  <U+2460> zinc (which is the transport mechanism for Laetrile/vitamin B17) <U+2461> vitamin C (build up to 6 grams a day) <U+2462><U+FEFF> manganese <U+2463> magnesium <U+2464> selenium <U+2465> vitamins B6, B9 & B12 <U+2466> vitamin A <U+2467> vitamin E (at least 2,000 I.U.)

And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

ROMANS 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

God loves you so very much:))

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

God loves you so very much! God came down to earth as a man in the flesh named Jesus Christ. Jesus became the light of the world to save sinners from their sins. Jesus died on the cross for your sins, shed all of his blood, was buried, and rose three days later, according to the scriptures. He took your place of punishment for your sins so if you truly believe in your heart on Jesus and all that he did for you and put your faith and trust in his blood that was shed for your sins and trust in all he did for you on the cross, you may know that you have everlasting life and you will be saved the very moment you truly believe in your heart. God sees the heart of man. Will you believe on Jesus Christ today with all of your heart and trust on him and the shed blood that was shed for your sins?

Jesus is God in the flesh!

1 Timothy 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of Godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

JOHN 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way. No man, priest, pastor, church, religion, works, baptism, nothing but through Jesus Christ!

JOHN 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

ACTS 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

JOHN 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

1 PETER 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

We are all sinners and we are going to die one day and need to be saved from our sins to go to heaven

ROMANS 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

ROMANS 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROMANS 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

We are saved ONLY by GOD'S GRACE!

EPHESIANS 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

ROMANS 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

REPENT, turn to Jesus Christ, put your faith and trust in him alone, truly believe on him and all he did for you.

JOHN 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

MARK 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

EPHESIANS 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise,

When you truly believe on Jesus with all of your heart call upon him from your heart..Salvation is a heart decision and comes from the heart.

ROMANS 10: 9-13 If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

You can say something like this but make it from the heart::
                                OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN, I CONFESS TO YOU THAT I AM A SINNER THAT HAS SINNED AGAINST YOU. I ASK YOU TO PLEASE FORGIVE ME OF MY SINS. I BELIEVE JESIS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS FOR MY SINS, SHED ALL HIS BLOOD, WAS BURIED, AND ROSE THREE DAYS LATER ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES. I ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS MY LORD AND SAVIOUR AND ASK HIM TO SAVE MY SOUL WHEN I DIE. IN THIS I ASK IN JESUS CHRISTS NAME..AMEN"

"she should cover up when she is breastfeeding and  why not use a breast pump so that she doesn't have to whip her tit out in public.  I wouldn't like it very much if i saw that in public.  I believe its a personal private experience that the woman should only share with her baby."
"I agree. We as mothers do not need to expose our breast in public to feed our child. That's what receiving blankets are for. I would never expose my breast for all to see. I wouldn't like it either if I saw that. That's trying to attract unwanted attention. You can't be mad if people are offended by your exposed breast. Use a thin blanket or cover up and feed your child."
"By covering you're respecting yourself not others. I breastfeed all my kids in public. Most times people weren't even aware. A little modesty goes a long way."
"Looks to me she is the BULLIE! She exposed her breast fully and looked around for a fight! Since when does a breastfeeding mother pull her shirt DOWN , it's always Up so you are some what covered by your shirt! She did this to get attention! A breastfeeding mother is tuned into her child, looking directly into there eyes , holding there hand , caressing there head while they are feeding, she is not, she is looking around to start trouble!"
"I have no issues what so ever of a women nursing in public. It's a natural occurrence, but YES, she should cover herself. She looks trashy. I wouldn't want my young son looking at your bare breast. Have some respect for yourself, your baby and the public."
"I never breastfed in public, only because I didn't feel comfortable. I do think women should be able to do it though wherever the need to, but please, be discreet! No-one (who is normal) wants to see everything"
"Seriously? I'm amazed at how many people are offended by a woman breastfeeding their child but not by any of the advertisements that plague billboards and TV commercials using woman barely wearing clothing to promote merchandise."
"She is one who wanted to go viral now she has...naked women breastfeeding on her page.. I said she liked exposing herself and was using that baby as an excuse!!"
"I think Women should be able to breast feed anyplace BUT!!!! There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON that she can't cover her breast, not saying throw a towel over the babies head just put a small towel or ANYTHING over your breast. You've taken it to far!"
"There's lots of women breast feed in public but they do it without exposing themselves to this extent...unnecessary in my opinion."
"Im Swedish and we breastfeed in public and go topless on the beach so boobs on display is no issue here.... BUT, the way this woman gives her well rehearsed "" come back answer"" makes it almost seem like she is provoking people."
"No woman should ever have to cover to feed her baby!!!"
"Why don't you feed your baby at home?"
"Kudos to her!!! Feed your baby anyway/anyplace you want."
"by the way i love when i see mommies feeding their babies its a private time just between them not all of the public to see"
"I support Breast Cancer, lost my daughter to this, but I am OFFENDED that you are using this photo to support your Awareness page. What on earth has this got to do with sufferers of Breast Cancer?"

"I understand it's natural and all but it doesn't mean we have to have it shoved down our throats. No pun intended."
"does this mean i get to take a piss on a main street during the day? its a natural thing. please cover up, just for the simple fact that there is alot of freaky guys out there."
"Why would she not cover up while In public? ???"
"I believe that some mothers love the attention.."
"She wants attention. She's searching for people with the sole intention to make them feel uncomfortable, begging for confrontation. Cover up, it's simple and easy."
"Not necessary to show that much.  She's looking for a fight ."
"Just cover up. No big deal.<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D>"

"Back in the 1960s, a few studies found high levels of aluminum in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The research suddenly called into question the safety of everyday household items such as aluminum cans, antacids, and antiperspirants.

But the findings of these early studies weren<U+2019>t replicated in later research, and experts have essentially ruled out aluminum as a possible cause of Alzheimer's.

""There was a lot of research that looked at the link between Alzheimer's and aluminum, and there hasn't been any definitive evidence to suggest there is a link,"" says Heather M. Snyder, PhD, senior associate director of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer's Association.

Breast Cancer Survival: Early Detection Still Key
According to the experts interviewed for this story, the aluminum in antiperspirants doesn't even typically make its way into the body.

""The aluminum salts do not work as antiperspirants by being absorbed in the body. They work by forming a chemical reaction with the water in the sweat to form a physical plug... which is deposited in the sweat duct, producing a blockage in the areas that it's applied,"" says David Pariser, MD, professor of dermatology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and past president of the American Academy of Dermatology. ""Even [with] nicks from shaving, the amount is so negligible that it doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense.""

"I'm not giving up my antiperspirant... It took me too long to find one that actually works for me.  I'll take the risk.

On the issue of talc, folks who use it can try baby powder instead."
"Really when baby powder has been proven to cause cancer to,,dah///and the aluminum in underarm deoderant is killing people to,your gonna think twice,when you are fighten for your life,and have no hair, smarten up please,"

"This is beautiful! When I had my first son the nurses were jerks. They would push his head to nurse and to latch on then rub his face into my chest. I was pissed off as all hell,emotional and frustrated that he wouldn't latch on but i felt like they were rough. All she told me was "" he has to latch on and babies are very flexible and resilient to being hurt, he's fine you're getting too emotional over nothing"" i wanted to punch her in the face honestly. The hospitals in the USA should do this but they don't...they take the baby right away wash it,dry it then give it to you for breastfeeding. :( I didn't nurse neither of my sons though I dried up pretty quick...with my first was after 2 weeks and my 2 son made it almost a month with being bottle fed the breastmilk."
"Kourtney Smith... Ethel Smith..  Helen McGee Juanita Hill.   Haki Peace Montano Peace Montano Nandi Castro. 

Watch this little juicy baby slowly  scoot toward breakfast.

I remember  the first time I realized babies will try to come and get it when they're  hungry.  When Abasi was a baby I woke up in the middle of the night with my nipple in his mouth. Straight getting his grub on. I almost hit him cause  I thought  something was biting me. He's  still the first one to get in line for food to this day."
"Wow . No need to slam the baby on to its mom like that.  Totally careless. That nurse needs to do something other then labor & delivery. She is going to injury/kill a baby before too long."
"As a nurse I have seen this..It is awesome.  Hospitals are to quick to remove baby and do all the measuring..bathing..etc to allow Mims yo experience this."

"I wish my mum thought of doing something before she died."
"MARK 16:15 AND HE SAID UNTO THEM, GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.

1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
By which also ye are saved, if keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

ROMANS 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

1 JOHN 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

God loves you so very much:))

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

1JOHN 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye believe on the name of the Son of God.

God loves you so very much! All of us are sinners in this world who have sinned and rebelled against a holy righteous God and because of sin we have to face death one day. Sin is the reason we die.God came down to earth as a man in the flesh named Jesus Christ. Jesus became the light of the world to save sinners from their sins. Jesus died on the cross for your sins, shed all of his blood, was buried, and rose again three days later, according to the scriptures. He took your place of punishment for your sins so if you truly believe in your heart on Jesus and all that he did for you and put your faith and trust in his blood that was shed for your sins and trust in all he did for you on the cross, you may know that you have everlasting life and you will be saved the very moment you truly believe in your heart. God sees the heart of man. Will you believe on Jesus Christ today with all of your heart and trust on him and the shed blood that was shed for your sins?

Jesus is God manifested in the flesh!!!

JOHN 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

JOHN 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way. No man, priest, pastor, church, religion, works, baptism, nothing but through Jesus Christ!

JOHN 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

ACTS 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

JOHN 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

1 PETER 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

We are all sinners and we are going to die one day and need to be saved from our sins to go to heaven

ROMANS 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

ROMANS 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROMANS 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

We are saved ONLY by GOD'S GRACE!

EPHESIANS 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

ROMANS 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

REPENT, turn to Jesus Christ, put your faith and trust in him alone, truly believe on him and all he did for you.

JOHN 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

MARK 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

EPHESIANS 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise,

When you truly believe on Jesus with all of your heart call upon him from your heart..Salvation is a heart decision and comes from the heart.

ROMANS 10: 9-13 If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

The very second you BELIEVE in your heart on Jesus Christ and all he did for you on the cross for your sins cause God sees your heart and call upon the name of the Lord from your heart you will be saved. Salvation is a heart decision..Whoever comes to Jesus Christ he will in no wise cast out..Come to Jesus today and  get saved today.."

"Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed your children. It is not a sexual thing. Stop making a huge deal out of it and it will cease to.be a.big deal."

"Sexualizing breastfeeding"
"Pervert*"
"Hurts"
"Long time use of birth control pills can cause cancer for real. And taking them while you have it (not knowing you have it) is even worse if your bc is estrogen receptive. This is something that should not be otc."
"You really need to be monitored by a doctor while on the pill. Can be dangerous- I had some serious side effects from one pill but did fine on another."
"This will be good for some but you must be monitored on this type of drug.  Also for anyone high risk for certain cancers there are only a few you can take."
"Not to mention they cause a lot of breast cancer."
"Not agreeing with this his do you know which ones. Are affective in your system"
"I can see this going very bad."
"Well, actually for A LOT of people, it's NOT ok that Miley exposes her breasts.  I turn the channel when she appears.  I don't mind public brestfeeding as long as it's done discretely.  Some women take it too far and have their whole breast hanging out.  That's just not necessary.  And lastly, YES, breast are sexualized and have been for centuries.  Breasts were sexualized in the bible.  The song of psalms is all about the power of a nice set of knockers.  It's only natural for men to be aroused by them.  It's part of human nature.  To ask a man to turn off thousands of years of biological brain wiring is absurd.  Anybody that's into shaming men for being turned on by breasts has a few loose screws in my book.  It's all just a matter of respect.  No reason to bash each other over it."

"An inherent brain malnutrition problem which relates to REM sleep, taichi, heart rate stimulation therapy, lifestyle, & chronic diseases/imbalances:- A moderate increase of heart rate (HR) WITHOUT body movement, stress hormone, and food in stomach, could be the only way to facilitate full microcirculations deep inside your brain and other organs (to replenish nutrients and detox at cell level). Unfortunately, this happens only in short bursts during REM sleeps (see below web link), though oxygen exchange is non-stop for the brain. It happens even more rarely during day time because busy city folks find it tough to meet the 4 criteria mentioned above. Whereas, microcirculation for muscle cells (by simple movements to increase HR) comes easily. That is why many muscle men with malnourished brain cells still succumb to chronic diseases. Though wine/coffee/acupuncture/stretching/cannabis (before meals), and other heart rate stimulation therapies (e.g. electric/heat/qigong/Holy water/African drums/urine) can provide the same healing effect, it will disappear in a few weeks once you get used to the stimulant. Increased dosage may lead to serious consequences. The most efficient way is to do EXTRA SLOW taichi for 30 minutes before meals. This will earn you 30 min of brain perfusion, which is the same as a good 7-hour sleep (see below web link). Or else, you must spend 1 - 3 hours a day to do 30 sets of normal taichi /aerobics /sun salutations, or simply slow walks. But you MUST stop/meditate 1 to 2 min after each set in order to earn 1 min of perfusion time. Incidentally, this is equal to a 9-hole golf game (on foot of course) where you have to walk-and-stop 30 times. Do it everyday.

If you have chronic diseases, you should avoid all endurance exercises (marathon, lap-swimming, etc.), unless you train with the abovementioned exercises to repair internal damages (but easily cause joint and heart damages). By now, you should know the differences between active living with many breaks (which is healthy living even without exercises), active living without breaks, and a complete sedentary lifestyle. The latter two can be fatal. 

Chronic brain malnutrition can cause cell mutations in the brain which will slowly affect all downstream organs. That is why a remission after a successful operation cannot last long if the patient continues to live the old lifestyle with the same old brain. This microcirculation theory applies to all exercises, brain growth, cell mutation, chronic diseases, sleep, and people from 4 to 95. Some diseases (e.g. Alzheimer<U+2019>s, HIV, lead poisoning<U+2026>) become more difficult to treat once they affect patients<U+2019> rem sleep, and they usually do. 

Hope that Beijing can revert their taichi speeds back to the slower speed used before 1956, and apply the new knowledge to medical procedures and medicines, for the benefits of mankind.

"MARK 16:15 AND HE SAID UNTO THEM, GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.

1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
By which also ye are saved, if keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

ROMANS 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

1 JOHN 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

God loves you so very much:))

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

1JOHN 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye believe on the name of the Son of God.

God loves you so very much! All of us are sinners in this world who have sinned and rebelled against a holy righteous God and because of sin we have to face death one day. Sin is the reason we die.God came down to earth as a man in the flesh named Jesus Christ. Jesus became the light of the world to save sinners from their sins. Jesus died on the cross for your sins, shed all of his blood, was buried, and rose again three days later, according to the scriptures. He took your place of punishment for your sins so if you truly believe in your heart on Jesus and all that he did for you and put your faith and trust in his blood that was shed for your sins and trust in all he did for you on the cross, you may know that you have everlasting life and you will be saved the very moment you truly believe in your heart. God sees the heart of man. Will you believe on Jesus Christ today with all of your heart and trust on him and the shed blood that was shed for your sins?

Jesus is God manifested in the flesh!!!

JOHN 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way. No man, priest, pastor, church, religion, works, baptism, nothing but through Jesus Christ!

JOHN 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

"I have dense breast tissue, so was recommended to have ultrasounds in conjunction with mammograms. They found the largest (2mm) of my breast cancers with the ultrasound, the mammogram didn't pick it up.  Neither of them picked up the remaining 5 tiny tumours. I doubt I'd still be here without the ultrasound. Was it worth the money?..... you bet your arse it was! On the bright side, I only have mammograms on my remaining breast now, so that's a saving!!"
"I also have dense breast tissue, and was also recommended to go for a mammogram....then for an ultra sound. After the ultra sound they took another two mammograms so in total I had THREE mammograms in one day!  WTF.... I however still have a brown discharge(golden syrup with a bloody undertone)  coming from my left breast,  my neck arms and chest is bruised and has a horrible discolouration. No MORE mammograms for me I had it!"

they charged 
me $10 more for copay

results same day
are more accurate"

God bless all of you who are undergoing breast cancer treatment! You are beautiful and you are very brave!"
"It has been 6 years ago for me, still very fresh in my mind on a daily bases. I too shaved my head, I also had Bilateral Mastectomy. Best thing I could have ever done. Bless you and stay strong, you have a long life to live. It's only hair, it comes back. As far as breasts no big deal, your life is more important. Best of luck to you"
"I had m6 son shave my hair because there was no way in hell I was going to let the cancer rule my life."

I had a hard time losing my hair, but once it was gone and then you start having hot flashes, you will feel better.  Do you know why I think we lose our hair?  Because God knows how tired you get during chemo and the last thing you feel like doing is fixing your hair.  But the good thing is you won't have to worry about shaving your legs, arm pits and your VaJJ  LOL.  Take care and you will be ok."

"God Bless. it's been 6 years for me since my mastectomy. Love the freedom of NO BRA! 10 years since first occurrence 18 months chemo and 40 radiation treatments. I to shaved my head...no big deal~I looked at it as no bad hair days,no having to shave the legs. and it grew back. Your life is what is important. Stay strong and brave <3"
"As a five year cancer survivor, I hope you have the same result as me. When my hair started falling out, our son, 2 grandsons and I had a head shaving party, its your badge of courage, good luck to you Shannen."

"I've just done the same after 2 weeks of chemo session number 1. I feel that is has given me some control, we can kick cancers ass ladies!"
"Majority of us shave our heads rather than see it fall. Being a celebrity I guess makes it braver. But it does I guess help those who are afraid to just do it. And it does grow back."
"Just curious...why do many women shave their head after cancer diagnosis? (Please don't take this wrong). I thought radiation makes that happen anyways."
"I wore the cold cap so didn't loose all my hair.....people used to say to me that their friends/family had had it worse than me cos they lost all their hair....used to really upset me"
"Don't be afraid to try a wig. My hair came back, and I had scalp treatments and used Renee Fureratur Hair products. My hair is not thick, but thin and strong."
"As a survived, I can tell you it's not a walk in the park, but attitude of yes I will does wonders. Prayer every day too. Kick it girl."
"Does anyone know what stage breast cancer she has?I haven't heard much about it other than the fact that she has it.Best of luck to her."
"I wasn't going to let Chemo take mine. So I took it myself."
"Was in the same spot six years ago after the chemo and radiation!! I really learned who I was and what mattered most to me!! And how strong of a person I really was!! And you know what I liked her!!

"I did the same, after 45 years of long hair... not shave but cutted short, since it never fell down"
"Good luck Shannon, I have been there and I am still here on earth!!"
"14 years and still counting DON'T give up the fight!!!!"
"We lose our hair because the medicine is working. It'll grow back its only hair. Hair is dead anyway, just like nails.5 yrs ago for me"
"My sister shaved my head. It is a lot easier then watching it fall out a little at a time."
"Been there, done that! Praying for her! I'm a survivor now and she will be too."
"I had my husband shave my head when my hair began to fall out.  2 time survivor and have a thick head of hair."
"Prayers being sent your way.... hang in there."
"SOOOO SAD!!!!"
"Sending prayers your way for your recovery. God Bless."
"Have pictures from when I shaved mine also.  Hair started to fall out right after 1st chemo in Jan, 2004.  Chose not to go through the ""falling out"", so shaved it.  Good news is - I'm still here and cancer free!"

No but the end result is these kids all are hurting"

"I pray that you make it through this , Shannen. I know you don't know me, but, as a fan, and a fellow human being, I know you need all of the support and compassion that you can get, during this difficult time. God can do anything, may the Lord bless you and your family."
"Shannen Doherty, you probably wont see this but first off, I am so sorry you're going through this. I grew up with you, watching you, and I have good thoughts for you. My mother had breast cancer that spread to her lymph nodes. It was called inflammatory breast cancer and If I remember correctly, stage 4. There wasn't much hope back then. I think I was a junior in high school so around 1991/1992 we found out. She fought like hell and never stopped working. She even finished college. Yes, she was exhausted but she knew what she had to do.  During everything she had surgery, radiation and chemo. Eventually she had to have a heart transplant. That took place on my 30th birthday, so almost 12 years ago. She is still here. Its rough sometimes, she was depressed, she was happy, she wanted to give up, she wanted to fight, she wanted to not be sick...but she was. The good days are much better than the bad days. You can do this. One thing I would say is try to keep a high amount of green foods. I'm sure you know about all this. My mom used to get something from someone named Dr. Sun. It was some very unpleasant soup that would come frozen and she ate that. Not sure where Dr. Sun is or if he is still around. I know you can win. Don't ever give up on your life and always look towards tomorrow and plan something small but great for the next day. HOLD ON."
"Much Love Sweetie...I went thru 2 different chemos every 3 weeks for 8 months. One into a port in my chest.  And the other thru a spinal tap. Both back to back every 3 weeks. I'm praying for you"
"Shannon I am so very sorry for what you are going thru.. I also have been there and no one knows the feelings it brings  out in you. the fears it instills in you that never ever go away.. Make sure they are doing the best of the best and if you are not happy with them go find someone else.. You are your' best advocate.. Fight lilke HELL!!!!"
"Is that picture of her and her mother? It took my breath away. I cant imagine what she is going through, somehow that picture gives me a glimpse of it. Stay strong, beautiful!"
"I wrote this for my sister who battled small cell lung cancer. I dedicate it to all cancer patients.

BEWARE_THE VISITOR!!!!
""What can I do?""  This coming from me, the one who is never at a loss for what to do.

""What can I say?"" This coming from someone who hasn't shut up in more years than most have lived.

 A new visitor has moved into our home.

This visitor has sucked the life out of a once happy place and moves from room to room to make sure no ounce of life is existing. The visitor has taken over what we eat, what we think, choices we make and just is a nuisance in everything that we had hoped for the future.

The visitor moves fast, doesn't apologize and always leaves the impression that no one is in control but it. Snarling, laughing, holding on tight are all the unwelcome  gestures from the visitor. We want to punch, hit, hurt and maim but this visitor has an impenetrable skin and holds strong against all attacks by us.

Crying, hurting, lashing out has no bearing on the visitor's soul. The more we hurt, the more it intrudes. Hate is such a strong word but is the only clean adjective to describe this life altering force that has physically and mentally drained all the want of life out of us.

Everyone gives different ideas about how to rid our lives of this beast but nothing seems to even move it anywhere near out of our life.

Watch out for the visitor. Guard yourself with everything you can because once it comes, it doesn't want to leave.

The visitor's name is cancer."

Hang in there, my prayers are with you for a speedy recovery. <3"

"I know how it feels. I'm for sure stage III but perhaps stage IV. Anxiety meds are keeping me from going off the cliff in addition to being left with horrid side effects of chemo and rads. Get used to the unknown. Once you have cancer you are at risk to have all cancers as I'm finding out. Even meds you take to help prevent it from coming back can cause cancer. It's a life long vigil and stress. Visit breastcancer.org. So much info there that you will never get from any docs."
"I've just finished my 2nd battle with breast cancer... just like the first time I don't worry about my future... I just think about living and being blessed that I beat that evil demon once again... live life to the fullest, smile, and laugh as much as possible... I didn't expect this either time it happened and will not expect if it comes back... life is short so live... live for urself and those warriors that are watching out for us above... enjoy each day.."
"I had a lumpectomy on the left in 2002, followed by radiation. Then a mastectomy on the right in 2006. Last mammogram showed me still cancer free after 10 years. I am now 73 years old and feel great. My prayers are with you, Shannen."
"My breast cancer had not spread to the lymph nodes for which I am extremely grateful, but i still had chemo and radiation as a preventative measure.  Been 7 years and am still cancer free.  But there is one thing I don't understand..reading the article it said she was diagnosed in Feb 2015 but didn't have surgery till this past May?  I certainly hope that was a misprint because if that really happened, then she needs a new doctor."
"Hang in there. I had cancer  with lymph nodes and chemo and radiation. It worked for 14 years. Than in 2013 I had a double mastectomy so far so good. Praying for you."

"I had Breast Cancer with 3 lymph nodes involved and i'm living a good life. Just have a bone density test done chemo can give you bone loss which i now have. It's either the Prolia Shot or I.V.'s for me which ever the Insurance company will pay for."
"Horrible news for Shannen. I hope she stays strong and gets through it! Today marks 18 years since I love my mother to breast cancer and a close friend of mine is also battling it, having just had a double mastectomy and now finding that it has spread to her lymph nodes as well.

My thoughts are with all of you battling this dragon - we'll slay it together!"

"Shannen you have to keep a positive attitude and your loved ones around. I am a 5 year survivor. I found my cancer stage 2 at age 37 with lymph node invovlement. I have a double mastectomy, chemo and radiation. I have been fine, but currently we found another tumor which may have been caused by the radiation. we are doing tests to see if it is cancerous now, praying it is not. Stay strong and know you have a whole sisterhood out hear to help you through your journey. Best wishes and prayers coming your way."
"Shannon Doherty, go to the Bio-Med center in Tijuana Mx, my feirnd beat her cancer there no chem, no radiation, she had lymphatic cancer, good luck"
"I had breast cancer in 1993 lost both parents when young to cancer mine had gone into lymph nodes took 8 out gone into 2 had a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy then radiotherapy 23 yrs on am really a very healthy 70 yr old so hope this gives you hope take care and go with whatever your body tells you be easy on yourself lots of love xx"
"Three years cancer free I had chemo and radiation lymph nodes out you have to think positive and you will get through it God bless"
"I have cancer also!! The main part was my left kidney!! Renal cancer and it spread to my left ribs and chest.. I had surgery done in April of this year 2016.. I stay strong, positive and have lots of faith in God.. Shannen I live by this don't give up!! Never give up!!!! I'm a fighter!! Just believe everything will be good... Keep positive all the time!! Love life"
"I had breast cancer 8 years ago now, When I had my first surgery they injected 4 needles into my nipple at the time, right before surgery that went into my nodes,So they also while removing the cancer took the nodes as well. They caught it early so I had a lumpectomy and no cancer in my nodes, also a PET scan done right away as well. I than had chemo and radiation. I took tamoxifen for 5 years. My Mother had died from breast cancer so they was all over it, It has been 8 years an here I am. So stay positive an Let it be in  Gods hands. GOD BLESS Shannen, an as I said dont fear it."
"I'm a breast cancer survivor - 8 years now.  I was fortunate that my nodes weren't involved; however, I worked with a lady who had several nodes positive.  She chose a double mastectomy & chemotherapy - she's still doing well and it's been at least 15 years!  Try very hard not to borrow all the 'what ifs' from the future, but live each & every day...one day at a time.  Find something, no matter how small, to be thankful for each day.  The Bible tells us not to borrow problems from tomorrow for the present has enough of its own!  Don't waste the time you have, whatever that might be, on worrying about things you can't control - look for some joy in every day!  God bless you and provide you with peace & hope"
"cancer is scary stuff... period!  I've never been a fan of hers, but she is human and going through a lot.  I watched lung cancer suck the life out of my dad in a years time.  So I feel for and empathize with everybody having to deal with this horrible, horrible illness."
"I am a survivor, 12 years out now. I had chemo, natural suppliments AND deep massage therapy and reflexology. The massage therapy moves the chemo around to reach ALL areas of the body. I have no residual effects from chemo and I'm STILL here! I highly recommend the additional massage therapy and reflexology to help heal a diseased body."
"Twelve year survivor, mine had spread to one node, didn't have chemo just rads....sometimes the treatment is worse than the disease...rads caused heart failure after 11yrs, but I'm still here and extremely positive..."
"I went through breast cancer lumpectomy, chemo & radiation too. I just made my 4 year mark free...it is a hard road but NEVER ever give up...Keep fighting Keep living Keep listening and enjoying. When I had the cancer I sat at home one day at my computer listening to the birds outside. Really listening to them. It was so beautiful. I was so aware of the nature all of a sudden. LOVE LIFE Shannon Doherty...take care..."
"The biggest thing she can be telling people is NOT to do  what she did. She waited months before having her cancer treated. I saw her on a program where she knew she had it but had not started any kind of treatment for it out of fear. I am a breast cancer survivor. Please....keep up with your mammograms and if you get diagnosed be brave enough to treat it. I wish her all the best in her journey. It's a hard one but stay strong you can survive this!"
"I am praying that Ms Dohertys cancer treatments will put her cancer in remission as there is one God who watches over all of us."
"have you ever heard of sour sop, my best friend had breast cancer 6 years ago, yes...she did chemo and radiation...and sour sop...she's now cancer free...but contineously drinking sour sop pure juice and boiling sour sop leaves for her drink daily. Sour Sop fights cancer cells from mutating...it won't hurt to try...I don't have one but I do drink too ( sour sop )."
"I wonder why the Doctors didn't remove some Lymph nodes to try to stop the cancer from spreading. I had my breast cancer operation in June 2001 and they took something like 11 (I think) anyway they took Lymph Nodes from my right underarm. I then had x amount of chemo and then everyday radiation. I've now been cancer free for 15 years"

"Steroid meds helped me tremendously, the first 3 treatments made me very ill but when I told my oncologist, he switched me to the steroids and I wasn't ill again. Losing your hair isn't bad either, is all in your attitude. My son and 2 small grandsons and I had a ""bald"" party where we all buzzed our heads, made it fun. Attitude is so important. Been 5 years now, I wish her and everyone else traveling this journey the best of luck"
"One breast removed and 17 lymph nodes removed....no chemo, no radiation....I wanted to live and that's exactly what I'm doing.....without the medicine....no worries....so get over yourself....Shannen....you are positively one of us millions of women dealing with it...the only difference...is we didn't go public......."
"I went through it as well, just this year.  Go into surgery thinking it's only going to be a mastectomy, find out two-weeks later that it was going to have to be so much more.  I'm only 6-weeks out from radiation and still suffering side-effects from chemo, but it's worth it to be alive."
"I too have cancer and it has spread to liver and lymph nodes. I have lost my hair but Shannen, keep fighting with all that you have. Rely on your strength even if you feel you don't have the strength, trust me, there is more to use. God bless you always."
"I just got done with chemo and radiation .I had cancer in my right breast and it was in my limp nods also. Keep a positive attitude and have faith in God . Chemo is rough on your body.,you can handle it you are a strong woman..I will pray for you.Just dont forget keep a positive attitude,,"
"You can share your stories and I know they are helpful however breast cancer as with any disease is different for anyone. My cousin is a breast cancer survivor. She was 21 when she was diagnosed with it and had no family history. I can understand why Shannen is worried about her future. I pray that she sees all of these up lifting stories and I am praying for comfort and healing for her."
"Keep fighting your positive will to live is your cure I had stage 4 and have been beating the odds for 2 years now, it was not breast cancer but it was cancer and I was dying."
"I have 2 sisters who have had breast cancer. They are cancer free now ten years later. I don't know if you will even see my note, but please be strong, it's so important to stay strong. Don't give up, fight it hard, and stay strong. Hugs to you."
"This happened to me twice. Diagnosed in 2008 at the age of 34 and again in 2012 at the age of 37. Both times in my nodes. You got this Shannen. The positive to take away from your journey is we have wonderful facilities, doctors, nurses and modern medicine.  It also looks like you have a wonderful support system which is half of the battle. Granted no cancer diagnosis is the same. We all have our own story to tell. However, in this day and age this is a beatable disease. I am proof of that."
"My mom was diagnosed early on and had a lumpectomy & radiation. She is doing well, I had genetic testing to see if I was a carrier which I am not. But I pray everyday I don't have to go thru what these brave and courageous women have to endure."
"It makes me sad to see this kind of stuff...  I really don't wish it on my worst enemy...I just want her up fall off the face of the earth....  <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00B3>

I was 3b nasopharyngeal cancer.  You've probably never heard of it.  It's a head and neck cancer...  I've had my uvula, and tonsils radiated away...

My cancer was head and neck...

I hope you can still TALK shit for me.  

Until then, get it, own it, conquer it."
"Stage III in 2009. Identical treatment. I went to work as usual except on chemo days. It wasn't fun but I don't like playing a victim. I'm still plugging along at age 67. No reconstructive surgery."
"How many of you know this----cancer cells feeds off of sugar---How does doctors explain how a 10 year old can die of lung cancer never smoked a day in her short life?..My father in law...was being doctored for the flu---six week later---they told him he had cancer in his lymph nodes----I ask my self----when I let the thought of love ones who has died from cancer to enter back into my mind--How much are we lied to by doctor and scientists?"
"I pray that Shannen beats this disease! Keep fighting! Breast cancer can be defeated, there are many survivors out there, cheering you on! God bless you, Shannen, and anyone else battling this disease. May the angels of the Lord surround you, and comfort each and every one of you, during your battle. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008F><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"Your Family, Friends, and Fans adore you me included. We're all Praying for a full recovery. Sending all our Love, anybody can beat this damn cancer hopefully it will be you!"
"So does she know that the cure is medical weed or does someone need to tell her? lol also it does make the cancer in remission just ask Brave Mykayla Also the other survivors thanks to this cure!"
"My mother had breast cancer in 1980 and she lived to be 80 yrs. old and most important she did not die of breast cancer. This is such a terrifying disease but there is real hope for a full recovery and I hope Shannon Doherty gets a complete remission."
"Have been there, done that and am not facing possible other breast involvement. Had 9 yrs cancer free. Lymph nodes are removed, and were removed after my surgery. Talk to your doctor, and trust her/him. As others have said, stay strong and positive."
"I am so sorry to hear about all the breast cancer patients and sincerely wish them the very best in life and hope they will turn to God for answers as they battle this horrible affliction."
"Stage three it spread to six of my lypnods and started on chest wall! Just one small cell but enough to cause panic to me.I had a double mastectomy the six lymph nodes removed. My tumor was almost a ten I had 23 sessions of the harshes chemo and 48 radiation treatments! They got all my cancer but one cell that had started on my chest wall so 48 sessions of the radiation burnt the cell up! July 18th 2016 marked a year and a half cancer free!!!! Your always going to have fear that will never leave. But always have your faith in God and always stay positive! Never let your mind bring negativity! Good luck and God bless all!"
"Your in my prayers! Trilled that a lot of people beat this dam disease and the people going through this hard time my heart goes out to you all and prayers! I lost my only sibling dear sister and best friend so I am trilled when I hear people are beating this dam disease! I hate cancer and it's a disease that hurts the entire family and it needs more funding in the hands of researchers not organizations that pay their CEOs $$$$$ to run their org! Prayers to all that are going to kick the hell out of cancer."
"Shannon , I ask the Good Lord to bless you and take away this terrible disease!! I ask him to give you extra strength through this terrible time that you  have to endure!! Stay positive!! My mom passed away from breast cancer 46 years ago at the age of 53. The doctor's have come a long long way of helping surviving Cancer patients!! Keep your faith and  trust in the Lord!! What we can't do for our selves, the Lord will. God bless you and your family . Amen."
"It is all about money. Please if you are suffering with cancer or know someone who is..Share this information..People are dying and don't have too...^j^"
"So sorry to hear that you are going thru this.  My Aunt had breast cancer years ago and is doing gr8 now.  Stay strong girl!  My prayers and thoughts are with you."
"Praying for remission!  Just out of curiosity, and I know it's not legal everywhere, but would possibly trying cannibis oil help at all? I've read stories that it has help some cancer patients."
"So many of us went through this...glad she has money...without it ..it was tough. Eat well..no preservatives..no red meat or pork...Juice with organic fruits and many veggies...No preservatives ..lots of room temp water.  not from the tap..no sugar or alcohol..ever...any alcohol will do much harm.  Wear just cotton..use only Dove products..no hair dye, no mani/pedi's for now..etc.  .Use .Baking soda ..to keep your PH to 7.3 7.6...sleep 8 to 10 hrs a day in a room at 67 degrees...Stay away from crowds..Good Luck.  Sorry I had to add on...I beat breast cancer a dozen years ago..Did go through ..3 operations..leaving my breast in..just partials...where the cancer was...then 6 weeks of day to day into Manhattan for Radiation, during 911,  in Memorial Sloan Kettering....which I believe gave my body so much life long pain and problems.and asthma from the dust particles.   PT works wonders. as does an Allergist to rebuild .Oh..and keep a diary of what you eat and drink , weight....and pray."
"A strict organic ""Alkaline"" diet for 60 days kills all cancer in the body. The public has been duped by the medical societies. We are being killed by the poisons in all of our food and liquids."
"I'm so very sorry for her and I will be praying!! I lost my Mom to breast cancer just over a year ago, she was very sick in the end. I wouldn't wish this on anyone."
"Praying for you Shannen.  I am a cancer survivor, and I agree, the unknown is the scariest part.  But stay strong young lady."
"Prayers to you all and to Shannen. On one thread some woman had the audacity to criticize Shannen's skin and say with her money she should have had taken better care of herself I guess she is uneducated and has never watched what cancer does to the body, skin, hair. Advances are being made every day and hoping one day for a cure!"
"My Mom (R.I.P.) had hers removed in 1998. She lost her life when the cancer came back and spread in 2013. God bless you Shannen, to you and your family. Stay strong. Fight the good fight."
"I don't love this news, but I'm sending Shannon love, plus prayers for a complete healing from breast cancer. Blessings to you Shannon. Please stay strong. You will beat this breast cancer."
"Cancer, is just too horrible for Me to talk about. This BASTARD DISEASE is taking ALL of My Family. I have a Nephew, that is only 51, and it's through his Body, and He's tried, EVERYTHING. There is NOTHING, more they can do for him, unless His insurance will cover a pill that is very expensive .I'm torn, ripped apart, HATE to hear when anyone is diagnosed with this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Lost my Dad to cancer.....his advice, and I would pass it on to anyone else - don't do the radiation treatment. It does nothing but makes your remaining days that much more unpleasant."
"Fuck cancer-keeping you in thoughts and prayers. You always seemed like such a bad ass, continue fighting and kick its ass!!"
"All the best to Shannen. I know what she's going through...my Mother passed of breast cancer. My prayers are with her. Blessed be my dear  )o("
"If the U.S.A. stops with all the radiation emitting by nuclear plants, weapons testing and more we will have less cancer...in the time of the Egyptians there was no cancer..we created it... Plant more oxygen producing trees and plants anywhere you can to help clean the earth from what we have done to it..we will live longer with less ailments..."
"Please check out PROTON therapy it works on most types of cancer is it just shared my tumor I am also an actor and it works no pain no side effects and no poison I had to go to Oklahoma City for four months but there is one in Loma Linda"
"Um, she kept the tumor in her body for a year and 4 months AFTER diagnosis while she ""decided on which surgery to have"" so yeah, not surprising it's in the lymph nodes.  

My breast cancer was removed within two weeks from the initial testing and began treatment.  Early detection saves lives.  Hate to say it, but if she dies, it's her fault for waiting while she decided what to do to keep her breasts."
"Praying for Shannon and all breast cancer warriors. My mother is a breast cancer survivor."
"I'm really sorry hear your cancer has spread. My aunt is going thru breast cancer as well"
"Well, yeah, the lymph is the system that has to be pumped by excercise and can only be cleaned with herbs and a fresh food diet. Doctors don't know that."
"Prayers of healing. I sm a breast cancer survivor. Be strong!!<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+00BC><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BB>"
"I had 21 lymph nodes removed and was stage III, I'm still here..8 years cancer free..I also did it without chemo,"
"do movie stars, new anchors, etc... have higher rates of cancer, including blood and bone marrow cancers? Is this an occupational hazard?"
"It's a tough road,but keep the faith God Bless. I myself have had breast cancer  and chemo so just stay strong"
"My prayers are for you, Shannen, as well as your family and caregivers. I pray for comfort, strength, and wisdom.  I am sorry your cancer has come back. I will keep my prayers going and follow your journey to health."
"You hang in there. I had breast cancer 2 years ago and mine was in one lymph node . so take care"
"She is just one year younger then I am and this bothers me alot. I hope and pray she can beat this cancer prayers and thoughts are with her family at this time."
"Cancer sucks...my family is goin on 3 years :( prayers to our fighters"
"God bless, I have breast cancer also, no fun!"
"Keep smiling Shannen You will make it thru Chemo and Radiation MY WIFE DID ."
"This is so sad. Just in July alone, I lost two very dear people to cancer. Cancer is an asshole."
"My 19 year old daughter was just diagnosed with breast cancer i am so scared for her :("
"Seems like some commenters don't understand the huge prognostic significance of when cancer cells are found in lymph nodes."
"Dammed cancer can get anyone.. They need to figure this out as it seems breast cancer is common now adays"
"Rooting for you; wishing you success in your treatments. Be well! I'm a breast cancer survivor, too."
"My mom is a 2x breast cancer survivor. She chose to have one breast removed the 2nd time around. Her feeling at 60+ was...I don't need the dam things anymore so lop them both off if you have to!! Her positive outlook was amazing! She was more worried for her grown, adult kids than she was for herself. Like others have stated...keep the positive attitude going strong even though some days you may just want to hide under the blankets and not come out of your room! My mom was out of bed and sitting in a hospital chair before I decided to sober up and go and visit her and eat her yucky hospital food and have a nap in her bed :)"
"its really sad too see somebody,  thats so well recieved by all , struggle with life and all its crappy curveballs, i hope she walks out the other side owning it and saying F you, it's a  battle but you can and will win the war with everyone,s support and good vibes.; im not religious by any means whatsoever , but GOD BLESS i hope it all works out and everyone involved can find some peace and understanding in the journey,"
"I just lost my mom to this, stage 4 bone, breast, and liver which we just found out right before hand. The gene is in my family I have to be careful and get checked out this is very sad for her to go through this but she is helping millions of others."
"Cancer SUCKS! And unless you've gone through it, you don't really understand the fear. I knew I would lose my hair, so I went and had it shaved off, so I wouldn't go through what Shannen did. I read it was a control thing. ONE thing I could control in the midst of things I couldn't control. Learning to accept that your hair or any other part of your body does NOT define who we are! I am still ME, without a uterus! Praying for a good outcome."
"God Bless and keep you, so sorry.  I was just watching the HGTV of you buying your house.  It is never easy, but keep fighting.  You can do this.    I get so angry that with all the money given they can't find a cure for this scourge.  Hugs and prayers."
"I'm truly saddened to hear this news. Shannen doherty is a stellar actress and has tremendous character. I pray that the treatments will do their job and rid her body of the Cancer. I know actress/advocate Mariel Hemingway is a firm believer in Juicing. to work(holistically) in tandem with the traditional(medical) form of treatment. Shannen has always been a favorite of mine as she is a true artist. my daughter gave me for Christmas he book, ""BADASS""  her creativity and ever Unquenchable thirst for knowledge is so apparent in that book. Love you, Shannen!"
"You know no matter how crazy we can get at times in our lives nobody deserves to go through the agony of the unknown like she is right now. I've never been a fan personally but she is a human being with fears and pain like the rest of us. She has loved ones that are scared for her and Im sure she is scared herself too. Good luck in your fight Shannon, I will pray for you and your family :hug:"
"I was just diagnosed with a thyroid disease that has now taken my job (that I lost today). I fear for my future as well. Something about Shannen's story is helping keep me strong ... if she can fight this, I can fight my disease too."
"Diagnosed with AML in march. Just finished last bag of chemo. Hopefully bone marrow biopsy will come out clean.  It's so easy to crawl into a hole and give up. Stay strong. Stay positive. Prayers and family and friends are a powerful healer. I  am a leukemia survivor, proud of my bald head, proud of my battles. Stay strong!"
"Just went through what you are going through now (Sept 2014 to present). Had the surgeries, the chemo and the radiation. It was rough but, you can make it. Do not fear what you cannot control. Just concentrate, one day at a time, on what that day brings! Peace & blessings to you!"
"Hey hun,I'm so very sorry you have to go thru this.I had cervical cancer back in 1989 and the dr.did a vaginal partial hysterectomy.So I understand but I know we do not know each other,but I know you are a strong willed woman stay positive,have faith and everything will be fine.ok I'm sending my love & my concern,& to let you know I'm here for you ok hun luv bh"
"I'm a year ahead of you in what you are feeling. May I suggest to you fight the abyss that we can so easily fall into of worrying about the unknown. I've learned to appreciate each moment and realize there are many before me who have gone on to live very fullfilling lives. Nancy Reagan to name one who lived into her 90's and she had been dagnosed during her first lady years as her husband was Govenor of California! Sudh an inspiration and there are so many more. Trust your medical team and take it one moment at a time. Praying for you!"
"I felt so sorry for Ms. Doherty when she said the press said she looks worn and haggard, not knowing she was so ill.  She came forward and told her story with the hopes of helping at least one person.  You are in my prayers."
"I am also breast cancer survivor, just keep on praying & be strong Shannen...God bless u..."
"Shannen I am not one to comment on things and I don't  know anyone going through breastfeeding cancer but your story moved me! I am so sorry for what your going through  keep the fit and I am praying for you and stay postive you will see this through! God bless"
"She is in my prayers. Don't know her but of course memories of 90210 are always there. These public figures don't know us but it does not matter. What they do is for the public and a piece of them leaves their own person and becomes a part of us."
"Ooh my God!!

"I can't even imagine the pain and horror of this. I have no idea. Maybe someday i'll get cancer, who knows. It's so random and it is such a horrible thing. I am so sorry to anybody who is suffering or the suffering of a loved one close to you."
"I known it's easy to ask you to stay strong, but positive attitude is  the key. I was given 2 months by 2 doctors and met a 3rd and have been cancer free for 26 years. You will be in my prayers"
"I agree Laura about staying strong and being positive. But the best thing would be if you also put you faith in God! I loved you in the tv series. I will put you in a prayer group which dedicates themselves to praying continuously for people in need. God bless you always."
"To everyone out there dealing with this disease, this issue, this problem - it includes men cause we get breast cancer too, remember - sending peace and strength and hope to y'all from Atlanta. Never give up, keep fighting, look for support, live everyday to the fullest, and love, love, love yourself and every person in your life. Peace!"
"I do not know you personally but only your talent. You have brought many hours of joy and entertainment to your fans and public. Stay strong girl. You can do this. I want to see you well and healthy in a movie or show down the line. God Bless / Get Well"
"U must have Faith as the size of a mustard seed,family support is very important,I was diagnosed with cervical cancer last yr,but God gt me through it and so do u,,this is just a test in yr life,so hold on,God have created us,Woman to be strong,and Gpd love u"

"Shannen, I am praying so hard for you. My mom went through the same thing and it spread to some of her lymph nodes. She went through some tough times, but in the long run, she ended up fine. I pray that you overcome this. I mean this, I don't live too far and I am in the medical field. If you need anything- someone to rum your errands or whatever, please let me know. I worked in the ER at Cedars Sinai for many years, so if you need any kind of help, please- I will help. Just giving back from What my mom went through too! God Bless!"

"Dr Simoncini , they discredit him , but I know personal cases were he has helped breast cancer without chemo or radiation. Chemo causes the cancer cells to spread. The medical industry  makes a fortune off of chemo. There is a cure ,(but they will never release it because they would rather make all the money coming in)The radiation is what kills the cancer .."
"Alot of us know exactly what you're going thru! Stay strong, keep your family and BFF' s close, Have Faith, dear....you will beat this! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><U+2764>"

"Prayers from one breast cancer survivor to beautiful soul .whom I will pray for."
"I was diagnosed with Triple Negative Invasive Ductal Carcinoma 2 mos ago. I'm 45... IDC is the most common form of breast cancer... The Triple Negative is the most aggressive form of it... They put me at a stage 2 because they found mine had also gone to the lymph node, but only one is affected as of now. Standard protocol is: chemo, surgery and radiation unless you have a bilateral mastectomy. You do, that removes the radiation (sometimes), and lowers your recurrence rate... As long as she fights it and goes through with her treatments she'll make it. Glad she's speaking out about this! 

Get mammograms... Get checked... The life you save could be your own!!! 

#StandUp2Cancer"

I send my heart & prayers to her. I've been a fan of hers ever since our house with Wilford brimley. Anders barber . & heather O'Rourke. In spite of the negative press."
"This is really heartbreaking to hear and I can't help but to think that we may lose another great celeb. F**k everything she may've done or said in the past. It's nothing compared to what she's going through right now.  I'm wishing her all the best and hope that she beats this and comes out stronger on the other side.  Stay strong."

"I'm going thru this right now. She needs to calm down. Dunno why they removed it first. I had inflammatory breast cancer the worst one. Chemo was done first to shrink the cancer which was also in my lymph nodes. They removed breast and nodes. When the tests from what they removed came back the chemo had killed all the cancer. But I am now doing radiation to kill anything that possibly could still be in my body. Hair is coming back now and I am doing good. I never got sick or couldnt eat or took any pain killers. Its mind over matter. I know it could come back but I don't dwell on that. Think positive. I'm gonna kick cancers ass. Sitting around crying about it just makes you weak. Get mad at it and fight. Its just hair it will come back."

I was diagnosed in 2010 - had surgery, radiation and chemo, but in today's world of medicine - it's not a death sentence if caught early, which mine was.

It is three percent of the population and normally runs in forty year old black men but it also runs in the white ethinticy .... Keep positive and continue to pray for Shannon Doherty her fight is to live and which ever kind of breast cancer she has she will over come .."
"For those who want to know and would like to give it a try:  cancer can be cured by cannabis which is also available in a concentrated solution.  I have known 4th stage cancer patients who have been cured by cannabis.  Also eat the almonds that come out of apricot stones -- there are cures that the multi-million dollar cancer industry would like to push under the carpet. Most people who die of cancer, die of chemo and radiation! Cannabis also kills cancer cells like chemo -- but it kills only the bad cells!  Works!"
"I was diagnosed almost 11 years ago with very aggressive stage III breast cancer.  After 8 rounds of chemo, 7 weeks of radiation, 13 months of maintenance drugs and a total of 11 surgeries I'm still here and happy to have just celebrated the BIG 60!  I had cancer, cancer didn't have me!  It wasn't a death sentence for me it was a call to raise awareness to end all cancers."
"I am a breast cancer survivor since 1998.  I have had a mastectomy.  Now  I have to go in for a needle biopsy on my other breast.  Shannen you are in my prayers....."
"As a breast cancer survivor, keep you faith and spirit up.  Let your support system in.  They may not know exactly what you are going through, but they will be there. Remember FIGHT LIKE A GIRL"
"This is really sad.  Also, why aren't more cancer patients told about using dry ice treatments on their scalp so they do not lose their hair?  It's so traumatic to lose your hair and look sick...this can be be avoided.  I hope she makes a full recovery."
"Lots of Prayers for your Shannen...   Hang in there...  Stay Positive and Fight this Horrible Cancer...  You can do it...  God Bless...  <3"
"Stay positive.  I had breast cancer twice in the same breast.  (they didn't take it the first time and 12 years later, had it again in a different area). Now 6 years cancer free.  You can do this.  My sister gave me a present, a small enameled box.  She said open it when you must then put your troubling thoughts back in it and close the lid.  You have a large sisterhood out here. Stay positive and strong - don't worry about the future, embrace every day and make it count."
"I know you probably hear crap like this all the time, my sister,Margaret, was just diagnosed with lung cancer in her left lung, It has grown  from a 3cm to 5cm to 7cm with our last visit  it is now 5""' yes I say 5 inches.  The cancer has grown so fast, it is now in her ribs.  The Doctors have said she has a mass her stomach  and a 1 inch tumor in her brain.  She just under went a triple bypass lin June of 2014.  She has stints placed in both legs within the last 6 months.  I want her to have some hope, but right down its very hard to find, God be with you n your journey."
"Laura.  Sort for asking u.  Shannon's cancer spread into her lymph nodes.  What does thT actually mean ? Less hope.  I hope the opposite."
"It mastisized in me. The dirty bastard!  Spred to liver, wrapped around my tail bone and in my right lung.  All chemo and radiation has failed.  Was sent he to get my affairs in order and spend time with family and loved ones.  The pain can be unbearable.  But with the advancents  in pain  medications id rather be going thru this shit NOW then say 30-50 yrs ago.  My know when the time comes my Late Husband and Jesus will come get me for that HUGE party upstairs.  I know that there is a cure out there. I truely believe we already have it. They keep it a huge secret because there isnt any money in healthy ppl.  Amd they use it as population control.  Just my opinion. I wish nothing but the best for Shannon.  Cancer sucks huge ones."
"I am a breast cancer for 3 years ...it always lurks in back of my mind do I have cancer in another place in my body  that I do not know about yet?  the unknown is  truly the scary part  I was so blessed to know it was not in lymph nodes and radiation was what I needed. Keep positive attitude  I know easier said then done"
"Shannon. Had HER2 stage 3,  5 lymph nodes positive, had lumpectomy, 23 nodes taken out, chemo and radio. I'm 4 years cancer free, fingers crossed. One step after the other. The worry, that will never go completely away, but it's manageable. Much love."
"You are so right,not knowing is the worst.I had my lymph nodes removed, July 11.The depression I am experiencing is overwhelming. No one talks about it.I can't stop crying,can't get out of my bed.God is  all I have and he will see me through,until then I do the best I can. Trying  to stay positive."
"Sad to read this.  I remember the 90210 episode when her character dealt with a breast cancer scare.  And now she is facing this battle in real life.  Hope she gets well soon."
"Sad news but keep on fighting"

"Well done ladies.  It`s important to be positive, even when the unknown is scary.  I have had two scares in 6 months with my other female departments and bleeding from the urethra also fast tracked.  The doctors could not ID the problem, but it`s not the C word thankfully.  We all have to find our own way of exiting the fear, but being loved and supported means so much.  For all of you my love, hugs and support.  XXX"

"Sweetie, as my mom would say, "" I have a good feeling about this"". She was always  right. First year, L was diagnosed with breast cancer, next year my middle sister got it. Third year my baby sister got it. All of us lost our body hair and now 22 years later have to get our hair thinned when it grows back so thick. You were smart to shave your head before your friends had to come after you picking up your hair...LOL. A good sense of humor got me through it and my two sisiers knew they would be okay cuz they saw how I was doing.. Be assured that you have a whole sisterhood praying for you."

"Shannon I am 56 years old and this is the third time I have been diagnosed with breast cancer and I don't even have any breast left. I absolutely believe the story about your dog because my dogs out and did exactly the same thing before I was diagnosed a very docile Mastiff started to sit in front of me and bark excessively this is a dog that never even barked at the mailman and then one day he jumped up and took a little nip on my right breast. Needless to say he knew that I had cancer for the second time before I knew it. Unfortunately he also got cancer we were sick together he succumb to the disease and I am still here I miss him every day. He was a French Mastiff a Bordeaux. Good Vibes and lots of prayers coming your way."

Here I am 12 years later, cancer free with a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The time you will go through with chemo, hair loss, all the sickness and pain is short-lived. once you get past that you will live again and you will enjoy life. I firmly believe a positive take no prisoners attitude is what got me through and I pray for you and hope that you will find strength in the massive amount of women and families who have been touched by cancer and have not let it define them. Cancer is just something I went through and is a part of my life, but it's not who I am. God bless"

"My guinea pig who is pretty aloof compared to dogs and cats always came out of her igloo hiding when I was/am at my lowest lows.

Everyone needing unconditional love that's not getting it elsewhere especially should have such pets to help get through the darkness."

"Simulation of REM Sleep :- Exercise can refresh/detox muscle cells instantly. But it can't do the same thing for brain cells (plus many internal organs including skin and bone) until you stop moving. Once you stop, your heart rate starts dropping but your blood may still have a few tens of seconds to refresh/detox your brain cells, only if these rules are met : elevated heart rate, no body movements, empty stomach, and no stress hormones. If you compare these rules with REM sleep<U+2019>s, they are identical. So far, the most ingenious way to simulate REM sleep is to slow down your taichi movements markedly until your brain thinks that you are not moving. Then, the effect of a 30 minute session would equate to 30 minutes of blood perfusion or 7 hours of sleep. This taichi microcirculation method was once used in China around 1900. Unfortunately, people made taichi faster in 1956 because they didn't understand this heart rate stimulation therapy theory. They also didn't know that they can get around this  <U+201C>too fast<U+201D> problem by doing 30 sets of modern taichi in 1 day, which is exactly like playing a 9-hole golf game, or walking (and stopping) 30 times a day. These start-stop methods are time consuming, but they are still very effective.

All food stimulants, muscle stretching, acupuncture, cupping, etc. are short term fixes. They can work well initially if you follow the same rules. However, the effect can disappear in a few weeks time when you get used to it, and you must be smart enough to rotate stimulants. 

Most folks in big cities have this brain malnutrition problem because of insufficient sleep, constant stress, contaminations, and bad lifestyles. The problems would trickle down to downstream organs and form chronic diseases  in a few years time, or even cancers at a later stage. Caution: If you can<U+2019>t stop these bad habits, not even taichi can save you.

They all live far so easy to keep secret. Imagine my surprise when she emailed me asking me if if I'm really ok. Not only that but around the same time 2 aunts on my dad's side of the family had the same sense about me and asked my dad if I'm really ok. Very weird."

"A friend told my mother that it hurts like hell so my mom refused to get one. By the time they found her breast cancer it was widely spread. A few minutes of discomfort are definitely better than the alternative."
"Ya know what's scarier.... Cancer treatment.  Without mammograms some of us wouldn't be here today."
"I never had this response. Mine was ""OK,  now we deal with it"" lumpectomy, breast reduction, 3 months of chemo, hair loss, 6weeks of radiation. Done! 5 years later I'm thankful for the drugs that diminish my bones, because now, there's Prolia, a shot every 6 months and, my 5 year drug is now recommended for 10 years, OK lets do that then. I am so very sorry for anyone that has to go through this but please, stay positive,  because that's the easiest way to get through it."
"i m the only one having cancer in the family, among other serious problems; i dont  handle it, i let life flow and hope to be around some more years, that s all. by the way, hormonoterapy does not    always hit your bones or gives hot flashes...i had none of them, although i have severe fatigue for instance and i ll go for 5 years more hormonotherapy instead of 5 as it seems it keeps us alive longuer. i really dont handle anything...i let it flow, as many things in life..and no, i haven t done anything wrong to have it either..shit happens, you know..i had much worse than this cancer with my twins extreme prematurity..it ends up to be a piece of cake, even if for sure will kill me sooner or later..let it flow..."
"What did I Do Wrong? I keep asking this. I had breast cancer 25 years ago, since then I have been a bit of a health nut doing what my doctors said and more. I was diagnosed again with a different breast cancer this year. I'm rediculously healthy per my doctors so how? How Can I have this again? What do I tell my daughters on how to protect themselves? There are no answers it seems. finding a cure is good but could we find the cause please, so no other person has to deal with the horrors   of surgery and treatment.  I'm almost at the end of the rough chemo and still have other treatments to go through."
"This really hits home.  I felt like the floor opened up and was engulfing me.  Your plans, your future is now gone, out of your hands.  It's all up in smoke.  All of your dreams, gone, because your fate is not in your hands.  Will it come back?  Where?  Will I be here for my special needs adult son, will I see my grandchildren grow up?  
After a bilateral mastectomy, and seven years from that day, the same questions are always on my mind.  The fear never goes away...never."

"I'm 44 years old.  I've lived with MS since I was 27 years old. Then at 40 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, Stage III, Grade III, T2.  Bad thing about the cancer is, I can never take my MS medication ever again, Rebif shots, as it stimulates cancer cells.  I was told basically to choose - either let MS kill me or let cancer kill me.  I chose to live with MS and fight to keep my cancer away!  My husband has MS as well.  He was diagnosed at age of 19, BEFORE we met.  Took 5 five years after our marriage to find out I had MS.  I was told to stop having children.  As after our second child was born, my symptoms came out RAGING.  Couldn't walk, went blind, numbness and tingling...  If we were to have more children, the stress would be too much on my body.  So we stopped having children.  Thank god I had my daughter and then my son. After that we were done.  Now my children have a higher percentage of developing MS.  It's not suppose to be genetic, but who knows?  I thouight having MS was a death sentence.  That is, until I started treating with my medication and it was helping.  Then I was told I had CANCER. That was more of a death sentence to me.  I just hope and pray to god that I stay healthy and that neither disease takes my life!"

"I love pink and usually buy a few pink ribbon things that I have happily used the last four years as a survivor. I don't donate to Komen but I do donate to another organization that was a big support to me during my journey.
Believe it or not, when I wear my survivor pin during the month of October or scarf or whatever, I have had people come up and ask me questions. Maybe they were afraid to go get that first mammogram or what have you but meeting a survivor usually sparks a discussion and it has been amazing to meet people who have survived for 30 years. It's just a really happy month for me because I had my surgery in October and now I'm past all of it and I'm just so proud to still be here and healthy. But I understand that many organizations don't donate the money for research.  Awareness is important for sure. Congrats to all of us and I pray we all have many more healthy years."
"I'm a 11 year survivor and I love all the pink stuff.  I use it for breast cancer awareness events all of the time and for my personal use.   I know buying it doesn't go for much of anything, it is just a way to make things nice for the guests at our events."

"Good for them. However I honestly don't feel like they have any clue what most women go through with illness. They don't worry about copays and deductibles. They don't worry about losing their job or their home. They don't worry about paying for meds or putting food on the table. They have the finances to get the treatment they need. They have the support of family and friends and the media. I'm happy these stars have survived but I guarantee they have never once felt as I have."
"Love this!"

"Yes, I lost my mother and my grandmother. You are so right about your mother and we share at least this about what we miss so dearly:1.	Her laugh:  She had a great sense of humor; but she did not like my jokes, or my Dad<U+2019>s jokes!
2.	Her sense of fun: My mom knew how to have a good time, I have seen the films and the photos, but she never allowed herself the time when raising five children. 
3.	Her yoga/swimming: My mom was a staunch believer in academics over athletics. I have spent years learning to be athletic on my own!
4.	Her sense of style: My mom had a good sense of fashion until she became too weary from raising five children. I look at old photos and I wish I knew her when she was dressing Chanel/Jackie O style without spending the money on designer labels.
5.	Her reassurance: My mom could be a tough-as-nails hard-ass when she wanted to be, but she was also a therapist and always knew the right way to tell me how to manage friend drama and dating troubles. I know she would have been the most helpful with my son when I had trouble, she died when my son was two years old.
6.	Her way with kids: It's so painful to me that my mom will never know my son. She would have adored him and he would have adored her, too. 
7.	Her hands: They were evidence of how hard she was always working, and she even tirelessly gardened without wearing gloves.
8.	Her music: My mom was a huge fan of the folk music of the 1960s, and I grew up listening to her Judy Collins albums. The rest of my household was listening to Rock and Roll.
9.	Her help: I can't even count the number of times I had no one to help me except my sisters after my son was born. All my friends had moms. 
10.	Her driving: My mom was the only person I knew who was a worse driver than me. I totally miss her being here to make me look good! Actually, I am no longer a bad driver, but I was when she was alive.
11.	Her sense of history: When did I walk? Was I always so talkative? Was I picky about fashion? My Dad did not recall these moments in detail, he was always working. But he is also gone (prostate cancer). 
12.	Her family: Some families are made stronger by losses. My sisters and I have to work hard to stay in the loop with her wonderful family."

"Shannon  you look beautiful!  Last year my daughter (Lauren Hubert Smoke)  fought bc and was pregnant. Kudos to you and other beautiful warriors. You help others and you probably don't know it. Your strength comes shining through. <3"

"Shannen was really annoying when she was on TV. That being said, I am admiring her now for her bravery and determination to beat her cancer. I've lost friends to this disease and I feel for anyone who has to go through this. Shannen, I hope you can kick this in the ass and annoy me again in the future."

But this story speaks volumes to this woman's strength and drive. I could care less that she is famous but I do wish her a fast recovery and a speedy return to health. She is a human like the rest of us and I wish her well. Stay strong miss Doherty, may your strength inspire others who are suffering."
"It's great she can go to the gym. Personally I used the day after chemo 'high' to clean the house and do the laundry. The drugs given during chemo treatments such as steroids produce a temporary sense of wellness that unfortunately is very short lived.  Just saying...."
"Wow. This is so inspirational.  I normally cannot stand celebs...but when I see them like this, as an actual human, it makes them a role model."

"I went numb, like my whole world stopped and it felt like a bad dream, then I just cried for hours. I was already dealing with my dad having lung cancer and now me, how do I tell my kids, my family, my friends. How can this be happening, why me, what did I do to deserve it? I don't want to die I want to live. I was so angry with the world, with everything, so many emotions. I spent my first night trying to get my head around the fact I had breast cancer, something you never think will happen to you.

"Mammograms never found my 2 cancer sites.....My Doctor found the first one during a Physical Exam and sent me for diagnostics.....It was the Ultra Sound done after the Mammogram that confirmed what the Doctor had felt. (followed by Biopsy, Surgery, Chemo and Radiation).....A Mammogram a year later revealed no findings on/in the remaining breast (only one was removed as Medicare would not cover having both removed UNLESS cancer was identified in both)...At the next Mammogram, nothing was found but a week or so later I found a lump and went back in to the Diagnostic Center.....I had found it while standing and applying lotion after bathing.  Another Mammogram was done followed by an Ultra Sound.  The Ultra Sound Tech could not find what I had found while I was reclined on the table.....I sat up.  She said she could not do an Ultra Sound with me sitting up.  I said....I cannot show you unless I am vertical...I cannot find it when lying on my bed....Gravity works for more than just Newton and the Apple.  She let me show her where it was and then could find it with me reclining.....This was followed by Biopsy, Surgery and Radiation and I was started on Anastrozole.  Pathology report of tissue removed was 4 pages long.  I had All 4  Kinds of  Breast Cancer having a party in there......Very likely some of that was already started when I had my first Mastectomy......Mid November of this year marks 4 years of that first day of You Have Cancer........It has been quite a Journey....SURVIVORSHIP starts when you First Have Knowledge of having CANCER.......something many do not realize.....You Survive the Learning, the Surgery, the Chemo, the Radiation and everything else that comes along....all cases are different..........................A Survivor"

21 mins <U+00B7> 
So, as some of you know, OCTOBER is 'Breast Cancer Awareness Month.' But what does that really mean? I mean, what are you supposed to be aware of? That Breast Cancer is the second leading cause of death among women? And that some committee somewhere got together and said, ""Hey, let's have a Breast Cancer Awareness month...."" and it was done? And someone else posted a few announcements on Facebook or Twitter or maybe bought an ad in some local newspaper or put on a pink wristband or a pink ribbon on their lapel or dress or.... SO WHY DO THAT? Here's why: Because as you go about your day, you're probably encountering no fewer than four people per day who know someone who is battling or has succumbed to or has survived BREAST CANCER. Say what? Four people a day? Then if it's that many, why wouldn't we already be aware of Breast Cancer? Why would we need to set aside A MONTH just to recognize it? Think about it: it's ALL AROUND YOU. Well, therein lies perhaps CANCER's MOST POWERFUL WEAPON. It's like the Devil roaming about like a lion looking for His next victim. Almost everyone knows someone who has been been bitten by that lion but no one wants to talk about it. Why? Probably because it's scary. Probably because it seems like one of those inevitabilities that we're powerless over, that maybe it will go away if we ignore it, that it's no way to entertain a compelling or harmless conversation because, well, it's CANCER and, really, who wants to talk about CANCER? I'll tell you who: your mothers, your sisters, your office colleagues, your friends, that woman who serves you muffins at the bakery; that banker who processes your checks; that bus driver who gets you across town; that attorney who is trying to get the best deal for her client; that husband whose wife just heard the words 'Stage 3' and he wonders why something so dangerous gets a number that their four-year-old son can count up to on one hand; that high school teacher who looks out over a sea of students and, because she's fought it herself, wonders how to share between equations, the 'calculus' of survival and how many of her students will become cancer's statistic; the firefighter who scales ladders of three-story buildings to break glass and pull out a terrified senior citizen, yet can't seem to step above the despair that his mother might not be around this time next Wednesday; that fine artist who turns to watercolors and parchment in an effort through fields of flowers and butterflies or roaring oceans and violent storms tries to make sense of it all; that EVERYONE who has been or will be TOUCHED BY BREAST CANCER. That everyone who is AWARE and somehow needs everyone else to be AWARE. Because if we don't make each of us aware, then CANCER WINS. But if we stand on a mountain top and yell, or simply entertain a one-to-one water cooler discussion that carry's the echo of a yell that is stronger and longer than the scream from atop a snowy peak, then CANCER LOSES. Because cancer hates to be exposed. Look how dedicated tumors are to masking themselves so that our bodies don't see them. Silent killer? There's none better trained, no finer master of the profession. Cancer hates the spotlight. Absolutely hates it. But when we talk about it, demystify it, pay attention to the man behind the curtain, then we are as powerful over cancer as the oncologist who detects it, confirms it, then zaps it or chemically bombards it or cuts it out or who uses the body's own genetics to turn on it and say: ""Hey, you're the invader! You gotta go!"" And that's why you should go and tell someone about Breast Cancer. Today. And every day, not just during BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH. Because we have to win. And to win, we need to identify the enemy and keep exposing the enemy until the enemy gives up and goes away never to return. Someday, there will be no BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH. Why? Because we won't need one. We'll reserve October for raking leaves in all their brilliance, we'll reserve it for little kids in masks giggling from door to door, and for hot mugs of cocoa warming our noses from the bleachers of the local high school football game, and for everything that promotes LOVE and LIFE. -- Dawn M.

If you can't donate please share and spread the word to help awareness and find a cure. Tia.

"I have known for years that I have dense breast tissue. My mother and her sister and her daughter have all had breast cancer and my dad and brother passed away from cancer so I do whatever it takes to screen for cancers. My OBGYN has told me to always do 3D mammograms (which I have to pay $50 out of pocket that insurance doesn't pay) and now I've been told I should also have an ultrasound (and I have to pay out of pocket completely) as my insurance deductible is so high I never reach it in a year. I gladly pay it as I have watched my brother pass away from cancer because the right test wasn't done to catch it early enough. Don't take chances on your own health!! No matter if it cost extra!! Does your life have a price??!!"
"I went to have a ultrasound done this past Monday and found out that I had dense breast.  Nothing serious but will always do what I need to do and take care of myself just to make sure everything is alright for now and the next 4 to 5 years and so on."

"It's a very difficult to digest. I was glad I had my mother with me when I got my diagnosed in November 2014. I broke down crying and she did too, but we calmed down and asked what where the n wed xt steps. It was  such a chaotic time with visits to oncologists, breast surgeons,  more biopsies & sonograms being done, MRIs, surgeries, chemo. I just had surgery 3 weeks ago and I'm recovering slowly, but surely. It's been a roller coaster. Thank God my faith in God, my doctors and my family and friends support has helped me pull through."

"Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the breast, it is called breast cancer. Except for skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women. Ask our experts: http://bit.ly/BreastCancerTalkToExpert"

"Thanks for sharing :)"
"Kayla Shields Sarah!"
"I understand that she is upset. I too had breast cancer and had a port and expanders and they had to do the same thing. It's protocol and we have to make sure that crazy people or terrorist aren't trying to carry bombs and anything else and pretending it's a port."
"Are these internal flights? Do American officials assume their own citizens are terrorists? I understand international flights having extra security but isnt a metal detectors enough for state travel."

"My wife went through a very similar situation at the Minneapolis airport. Prior to her going through I explained the situation to the TSA agent, since my wife was embarrassed. Once through the body scanning machine the lady would not take her to a private room and insisted on a firm pat down. I had already explained the drain tubes and suction balls. They were very aggressive to the point of my wife breaking down crying. Definitely not the way to start a vacation. 
I understand they have a job, but we tryed to be up front, so it was no big deal. Definitely not much training for this type of situation."
"Wow, unfortunately I see this behavior all the time. The way they address people is so unprofessional. I have seen them screaming at people. This is the first interaction with the passengers get when coming into an airport. I completely understand that they have a job to do. We all want to be safe. But everyone deserves respect and true guest service. This is lacking with many TSA agents that I encounter on a daily basis since I work within the airport. We need to do better as a whole.. I am so sorry for her traumatic experience and pray she gets through her treatments and is healed."
"This happened to me on  my way to PA!!! The lady was so rude to me and she practically molested me in front of everyone then took me to a room where they made me take off shirt. It was horrible it was in front of my son and also if she would have let me I could have showed her I had my port card."
"I get patted down every time I fly. I flew right after my surgery several times. If this happened to me at that time I would have been in handcuffs. They would have to restrain and gag me. Luckily for me TSA has been respectful. I just had it happen in Newark. It's intimidating and frightening especially when a woman is in this fragile emotional state. This is disgraceful."
"They were this aggressive with my 80 year old, wheelchair bound aunt. Too much power in the hands of individuals who aren't suited for it."
"I would have gone ballistic if they would have done that to me when I was going through the same thing as her!!! Absolutely not called for."
"Like Adriene Elzia said,""they need better training"".Well put.Theres no need for embarrassing anyone.Be safe but be a human being."
"Cancer, Mental Illness, broken leg or healthy, the bottom line is everyone deserves to be treated with respect. Abuse can injure anyone."
"My god touching your body really ???? 
I'm too sad how the way this idiots treated her soo humiliating !!!"
"Agents were not aggressive but i do agree they shud have not done it publicly"
"I don't think that was necessary.TSA is over doing it.So sorry she had to go thru such humiliation."
"That's messed up they need better training"
"They should be fired!"
"Disgusting"
"Just awful!!!!!"
"Not cool at all."
"This is horrible."
"Fuck the Terribly Stupid Assholes.  I hate to fly because of them. They hire low class  uneducated people and then try to ""train"" the untrainable. This person should be fired. This was uncalled for on any occasion."
"They have too search everyone"
"I am so sorry"
"You are so right"
"TSA is NOT ""a commendable job"",as you state in the article.
It has been PROVEN that they don't have ANY affect on catching  bad guys,but have had over 400 of their agents arrested for theft,and PERSONAL ASSAULTS!
They get low-income people with no training,and give them the power to abuse the public,and humiliate others.
TSA should be gotten RID OF !!"

"I was diagnosed with breast cancer and i lived with that diagnosis for more than 3 years, spending all I have and losing my self in the process, its what I wouldn<U+2019>t want to see any person go through, Luckily i had an encounter with Dr Patrick, a renowned Italian doctor that helped me overcome my cancer in less than two and a half months, just with the use of herbal medicine and spiritual help, i can now boldly say I am cancer free and a proud living testimony,he is known to be able to tackle any type of cancer found in the human body, God forbids any one should suffer here on earth, thats why I believe he created all these herbs, if you also want to clear your doubts and fight cancer to the barest minimum, take the bull by the horn and avoid death, you can contact my Doctor, by his email patricknelsoncancerdoctor@gmail.   com"

"To whom it may concern,

My name is Yun Hu, and I am part of a research team of Duke University School of Nursing. Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN and her colleagues at Duke University are conducting a research study to test the effectiveness of a technology-based information and coaching/support program for Asian American women living with breast cancer. This study is funded by NIH (National Institutes of Health).
Currently, we are in the process of recruiting participants to enroll in the study. We are looking for an Asian American woman aged 21 years and older who has had a breast cancer diagnosis in the past five years; can read and write English, Mandarin Chinese, Korean or Japanese; have access to the Internet; and identify their sub-ethnicity as Chinese, Korean, or Japanese. 
Eligible participants who agree to join the study will be randomly assigned to two groups. Depending on the group that you are randomly assigned, you may or may not be asked to use the technology-based program. You will ask to 1) use the educational information (the American Cancer Society breast cancer survivorship website that is provided by the research team), or 2) participate the online forum and 1:1 coaching/support program. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire for three times. Your participation will last about 3-months. After the program is finished, each participant will receive $ 50 reimbursement. Please note that your participation is voluntary, and you can withdraw your participation at any time. 
For more information, please visit our Web site (link:___________) and/or contact us by phone(919-660-1600) or e-mail (TICAA@duke.edu). Thank you for your interest.

"Two beautiful ladies! I am a breast cancer survivor and fought so hard against the cancer and 6 years later am still here! I remember the first real time of looking in a full length mirror for the first time. Body full of scars, hair breaking off, very little eyebrows, etc. My main concern was beating this and not concentrating on what I looked like but was a shock. Had great support from my husband and friends during the entire time. Shared my feelings with other women. Normal to feel that way and though I am not a particularly vain person, after some makeup and a funky short hairstyle started feeling better which helped me power through this. May God bless you both. You can see in profile picture that my long red hair has grown back and grew out curly. Thought it was cool."

"Medical cannabis and lungs cancer
THC has been found to reduce tumor growth in common lung cancer by 50 percent and to significantly reduce the ability of the cancer to spread, say researchers at Harvard University, who tested the chemical in both lab and mouse studies. The researchers suggest that THC might be used in a targeted fashion to treat lung cancer. (study)

Although the researchers do not know why THC inhibits tumor growth, they say the substance could be activating molecules that arrest the cell cycle. They speculate that THC may also interfere with angiogenesis and vascularization, which promotes cancer growth.
Cannabis doctors found that smoking marijuana does not appear to increase the risk of lung cancer or head-and-neck malignancies, even among heavy users. The more tobacco a person smoked, the greater their risk of developing lung cancer and other cancers of the head and neck. But people who smoked more marijuana were not at increased risk compared with people who smoked less and people who didn<U+2019>t smoke at all. 
<U+201C>We know that there are as many or more carcinogens and co-carcinogens in marijuana smoke as in cigarettes,<U+201D> researcher Donald Tashkin, MD, of UCLA<U+2019>s David Geffen School of Medicine tells WebMD. <U+201C>But we did not find any evidence for an increase in cancer risk for even heavy marijuana smoking.<U+201D> Carcinogens are substances that cause cancer.
  Marijuana use was associated with cancer risk ratios below 1.0, indicating that a history of pot smoking had no effect on the risk for respiratory cancers. In contrast, tobacco smoking had a 21-fold risk for cancer.  <U+201C>It<U+2019>s possible that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in marijuana smoke may encourage apoptosis, or programmed cell death, causing cells to die off before they have a chance to undergo malignant transformation<U+201D>.
These are good tips to learn from. And a friend request can be sent to me if you wanna know more and how to get good medical cannabis."

"Spot on. With my middle and youngest daughters I was only able to breastfeed them for only about 5-6 weeks before discovering they were allergic to my milk and had to be fed formula, people just don't stop to consider the reasons why someone might not be breastfeeding"
"What's the big flippin' deal? As a working Mom, I breast and bottle fed. My kids were fine, they thrived and are now brilliant and successful adults. So, lighten the hell up, already!!"
"I breast-fed both of my babies and they still got tons of ear infections and still got sick so that is a myth! And there immune system did not get that great of a boost and I breast-fed my first child so she was over-year-old and my second time he was nine months"
"Breast fed four babies .... there were times I wished they would have taken a bottle! LOL!  We shouldn't shame each other... as long as your child(ren) are happy and healthy!  <U+2764>"
"as long as the baby is fed and healthy, who cares how they get their food.  what is wrong with people?   we all need our own life and our own way.  I nursed my kids and two of them have asthma, it's genetic.  How you feed your baby is none of my business."
"So, wait. People get mad at mothers for not breastfeeding, but they also get mad when they breastfeed in public? ... I am one step more tired of humanity."
"I  didn't breast feed mine, even though I was pressured to do so, and they turned out to be healthy, I knew I would be working and formula was the better option"

"If it's not an option, then it's not an option. I breastfeed both my daughters, it was the late 70's early 80's. My Drs didn't agree with it.  It's too hard today, women have to work. There's no way I would go through that and work another job. Don't stress there are very valid reasons for not doing it."
"Love it,you do wot you have to feed your baby.  I was made to feel bad coz he didn't want my milk. But at the healthy age of 11,he is still amazing."
"You get crazy psycho mom's who feel it's fine to attack other mothers because they can't. Instead of minding their own business and worrying about their own kids they feel it's ok to pass judgement on matters they know nothing about."
"Mom's struggle because the information they are told isnt always right. Your told to breastfeed for 20 minutes. But did you know that your milk dont come in till day for and that your babies stomach is the size of a thimble or marble. If we nurse the first day of birth for five miuntes each feeding that will give your baby what it needs with colostrum, next day you feed for 7 minutes then day 3 for ten. By day for your milk comes in. Also alot of moms im one included especially with my first you dont get a good latch and you time your self both bad factors. Plus, its frustrating but your body will make enough milk for each stage of your babies needs. I was never told half of this or the fact when your baby is going through a growth spurt you should nurse constantly that day becuase by the next day you will have produce the right amount of milk for your baby. I am pregnant with twins so i am greatful i have a place that actually has taught me more about breastfeeding and the problems. I had nothing with with my first two kids. Theres a great video on breast feeding that explains and shows how to hold right. She also talks about fore milk and hindmilk. If you dont drain the foremilk you loose the hindmilk which is like whole milk.  We need more information and help especially after coming home with the babies. It is frustrating i went through it with my first, my second was different but still didnt have enough info or help."
"30+ yrs ago I had quantity not quality as bub got older.  So 9/10 months old bottles & rice cereal etc as bub had 4 teeth was the way to go.  Mums do what you want with feeding your bub & don't stress about what others say.  At the end of the day it's you & your bub that matter not P O."
"I was unable to produce at all, I was glared at many times for giving formula to my daughter. I was even called an uncaring mother. 
It's sad that people, even other women are this hurtful to each other."
"Just people are how they are , they always will judge 
More between women's is crazzy my god 
Competition between women's and jealousy ridicules  drama   .
The one doesn't like all that we step away from it 
No judging no jealousy people ."

"This includes a vaccine for Breast Cancer FDA Approves US Trial of Cuban Lung Cancer Vaccine  

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a US clinical trial of a lung cancer vaccine developed in Cuba.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the approval on October 26 at a press conference at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, where the trial will be conducted.

The vaccine, CimaVax, was developed for non<U+2013>small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has been available in Cuba since 2011.

The newly approved study will be phase 1/2 trial of CIMAvax in combination with the anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) in patients previously treated for advanced NSCLC. Roswell Park anticipates that the trial will take 3 years to complete and will enroll 60 to 90 patients.

CimaVax targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in approximately 40% to 80% of NSCLCs. EGFR overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, lower survival, and resistance to therapy in cancer. The vaccine's mechanism of action is to prevent binding of the endogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the receptors, thus denying tumors the growth factor.

The vaccine has been in development for 25 years. Studies have shown it yields a survival advantage in comparison with supportive care. Despite some mainstream news hype about CIMAvax, the benefit seen so far is not considered to be game changing, as previously reported by Medscape Medical News.

To date, CIMAvax has been used to treat about 4000 patients worldwide. It is approved for use in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Cuba, Paraguay, and Peru, according to the Roswell Park Institute website.

In a phase 3 trial, patients with advanced disease who had been vaccinated had a significant improvement in median overall survival in comparison with control patients who received best supportive care (12.4 months vs 9.4 months; weighted log rank, P = 0.04) (Clin Cancer Res. 2016;22:3782-3790). The researchers noted that the median survival (14.6 months) was longer in vaccinated patients who had high EGF concentration at baseline.

A US lung cancer specialist cautions that the expectations about this vaccine should not be overblown.

""It seems to provide a very modest survival benefit,"" said Jack West, MD, of the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle in an online forum held this past summer.

Dr West was commenting on some of the media hype about the vaccine that emerged earlier this year. ""As a rule, you don't need to debate whether something is a breakthrough years after it has been used routinely in another part of the world for many years,"" he said.

According to Roswell Park press materials, CIMAvax may also prove effective in treating colon, head and neck, prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers   http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/871110"

"I would be dead now if I hadn't had a mamogram"
"I had only cancer cells...no lump...never would have caught it before it was too late without the mammogram...I am for them!"
"Rediculous to say mammos have nothing to do with catching cancer...thats like saying the xray had nothing to do with finding a fracture lol"
"Foolish, mine was caught at annual mammogram would be in big trouble without having it.."
"My mammogram saved my life!!!!!"
"Mine was caught at an early stage by my yearly mammogram when I was 49. Lumpectomy and radiation were my treatment. I'm a firm believer in mammograms."
"I has to beg for a mammogram , my obgyn for 3 years told me not to worry . It was cystic breast disease and I needed to quit drinking coffee . Three years later when he brushed me off again I went to another doctor. , stage three in three quadrants and had spread . My persistence saved my life but earlier detections would have given me more choices . Women , know your body and don't be afraid to demand answers ."
"My cancer was found at age 40 on my very first baseline mammogram.  Less than a month later I had a mastectomy. My Oncologist told me that had I waited another 6 months the prognosis could have been grim.  8 years later I am fine.  Nuff said!"
"Ridiculous!  Sounds like insurance is trying to rule the roost again. In trying to pay less they are risking our lives."
"I agree, mammogram caught my in one breast, i found in second so that mammo was very helpful.can't always believe .take it from these ladies that know.thank god all are well."
"Found mine. My doctors and I could not feel the tumors. I would be out of here if I had not gone for my mammogram."
"Seriously??? Not true!  Get those mammos ladies!!!!!!!"
"I am really thankful for the mammogram testing.  It has picked up my cancer and being under 40, if I didn't get it done and waited, well who knows!!! "
"Saved me"
"I'm alive because of screening and early detection. "
"Saved Me so false"
"Me too...though mine was DCIS with no outward signs by the time I had lumps it may have been much worse"
"I found mine then had a mammogram for confirmation .... but the mammo didn't pick it up (a 2 cm lump); even though the doctor knew it was there. I personally feel that self examination AND mammograms are the best way to go.  Doing both is sure to pick it up.   If I'd relied only on the mammo it wouldn't have been found until too late."
"I never felt  a lump but the mamogram picked  it up"
"i never felt my lump but my mammogram showed otherwise. Within 3wks I've been thru the mammogram, ultrasounds, biopsys, bone scan, blood work, mri's and surgery. Iam grateful that I had my mammogram at age 40. I do not agree with the ""Mammograms have no impact on breast cancer"" nor do I agree with insurance companies wanting to wait until women are 50 to get their mammograms."
"Had mammogram was negative but it was wrong , MY cancer did come back only way I found out was thru a biopsy !!! God bless xoxo"
"At age 46 ,very first mammogram ever they found something did ultrasound biopsy was early stage invasive lobular, had lumpectomy, radiation ,on tamaxofin they are saying i only have fifteen percent chance it comes back, go for my six month mammo wed i have my fingers crossed, wish me luck!"
"<U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"Been there, but got second, third chance at life, cant give up, i pray all women get that chance as i did."
"I can see her point but on the same hand, cancer can occur in anyone regardless of how healthy or not they are."
"WHAT IS TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER http://goo.gl/N1oS8k #cancer #breastcancer #breastcancerawareness #breastcancerawarenessmonth #infographic #infographicspedia"
"I have had skin cancer, don't eat junk food, don't tan in any way, exercise daily. Didn't help, genetics is a pain in the....
On a side note, personal information, understanding and self awareness checks allowed it to be caught early, so education is key."
"https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2F1660326375%2Fwelcome-to-flex-press&h=FAQH3cL-4"
"You know as much money as Susan, and any other groups out there has brought in why isn't there a cure?  Where does the money go???????  What difference does showing off ones nipples do to the money being spent on what????"
"It's pitiful that the charity can't be trusted to use the money for research"
"There's so much hype and awareness about breast cancer, BUT so little about other cancers, like mine - Pancreatic Cancer????"
"I think it's pathetic that organizations devoted to raising money for cancer research are paying enormous salaries to their top executives.  Komen was founded by a breast cancer victim's sister.  Is she so jaded that she's forgotten why she started this in the first place? Her sister would be ashamed of her.  This was never supposed to be a money making proposition for her but on over $600,000 a year she is well above the middle class standard of living!"
"Nope don't wear one unless i absolutely need too"
"Yes. I get annoyed. When I was diagnosed almost no one gave me practical help even though I live on my own with a (then) 8 year old son, yet people give to these sorts of charities and feel they're helping.  What I really needed was help from more friends and neighbours"
"Worse and Biggest Fraud and Scam in US is Breast Cancer follow by other Cancers.

Breast cancer charity and donation failed to produce any treatment or finding of cure. Only the founder and few staff got rich. 
Breast cancer was also a man made mistake. In the 1950s and on, X Ray were being shoot directly to the front of women' chest. Knowing this have harmful to the body, they no longer do this. Avoid x ray and ultra sound as much as possible,  it's bad for you and your fetus and been know to cause cancer. Again breast cancer is common yet they hide it from the public. Because x ray still being use.

"Had a look through this Facebook page and I don't see anything about prevention. If you want a cure donating to cancer research program is a waste of money. Cancer is the most profitable disease in the world and theres no money in the cure. There's money in treatment. The cure comes with prevention and educating yourself about what's in your water, food, air and vaccines. Once you change your diet, detoxify your body, eat organic, supplement with vitamins, minerals and other things that our body needs our bodies will have a strong immune system to fight cancer off naturally. I know  a lot of you drink bottled water or other drinks which have BPA in the plastic which is an estrogen mimicker. Too much estrogen causes hormonal problems and breast cancer. Vaccines have aluminum, adjuvants, squalene, mercury and other additives that suppress the immune system and can be a catalyst for cancer to spread. GMO veg and fruits are modified to produce there own pesticide and cause sterilization and cancer tumors in all the rats. GMO corn helps feed cancer, helps it grow and spread in your body and everything has corn syrup made with GMO corn. Come on people get off your asses and make a change in your life. Research these things yourself and get healthy. Fight to get these chemicals, pesticides and other cancer causing agents out of our food and water. Only then will you see cancer rates fall. Only you can prevent it by getting educated. I can say this because my mon passed from stage 4 lung cancer. I did a crap load of research after she passed and I wish she never had gotten chemo. Chemo is the worst thing you can do to your body. Kills your immune system and when you get it the second time your body can't fight it off. Chemo side effect is cancer. Everyone has a natural form of cancer in there body and there is things like immune suppression, and other catalysts that can cause it to get out of hand where your body can no longer fight it off. Hope this helps some of you."

"Hi Angela, the issue with BCAM isn't about how the money is spent - it's about a campaign that is a deception. There is no 'cure' for cancer, cancer is a symptom of something else that is wrong. Cancer is a normal process that is out of control because the body is in a state of imbalance. Please join the side of common sense, just Google Ty Bollinger and change your thinking...."

"Some doctors really suck! When I was 19 I lost my 27 year old sister To cervical cancer Because her doctor In Phoenix Arizona For two years in a row did her pap smear and the results on both pap smears show positive cancer and she was never told or notified. she then changed doctors and finds out she had cervical cancer for those two years! So for those two years cancer spread throughout her body and she died less than a year later at MD Anderson in Houston. Early detection is so powerful and curable!

"Lee, I want to know if you have ever had cancer....  You saw your mother go through it.  I appreciate the research that you have done. I as a stage 4 breast cancer survivor agree with most of what you have said.  But I believe that each one of us that have some type of cancer have and are still trying to change our way of life.  This site was made to help the people that are sick to know that they are not alone.  The way your post was written I find very offensive!  I'm speaking only for myself, you can kiss the ass you think I'm just sitting on.  Have you changed your life since your mom got sick.  I sure hope so. I would also like to say I'm sorry for your mom, I'm sure she fought as hard as she could!  God bless you and your family."

"This is so sad. We as a society have made it taboo. In some peoples eyes if you talk about personal issues you are doing something wrong, or abusing or molesting your child or someone else's child. I'm sorry but as a parent I would rather my child come to me even it may make for an uncomfortable discussion. And busy bodies need to stay out of what is no concern to them. 
I'm sorry for these parent and families loss."
"Too sad!! open up talk to your parents! don't hide nothing about your body from them, no matter what it is!!! talk!!!!!"
"This poor boy and his family... how heartbreaking!  I am so grateful that I always felt (and still do, even as a grown woman) that my parents were people I could easily talk to about anything.  If they didn't have an answer or didn't know what to suggest, by God, we were going to sit down and figure this thing out!  Sure, there were things I wasn't keen to discuss with my parents, but I knew that, if I brought any topic to them, they would be honest with me and would help me to the best of their abilities.  Praying for this family... :'("

"How do you prevent cancer Lee when there are so many things that can cause it - even things within our own bodies? How do you prevent hormone receptive cancer?  Hormones are produced by our bodies and not everyone is lucky enough to know they're at risk.  You can't always control what's in your water, food, etc.  What research have done that's been published that can prove what you're saying?  Education doesn't always prevent what you can't control."

"I fought breast cancer. Surgeries, chemotherapy, hormone therapy...and am still here.  I lost a few friends to cancer.  I don't wish cancer on anyone.  This woman is all messed up or greedy.  That is unforgivable."
"As a breast cancer survivor who was a single mom at the time of a 9, 10 and 15 year old I am appalled . Anyone who has walked this journey would never wish it on anyone . I am still healthy 12 years later after surgeries , chemo and radiation . Just finished paying off the bill 2 years ago . It has affected every aspect of my life . Amazingly enough I would not trade it because my life was blessed with the people who helped me through this . 
You however have some serious soul searching to do not only to the hurt you cause your friends and family but your children ! My son still fears me getting sick again . Shame on you and yes I do think this is fraud and should be a penalty . You have already paid a price .... More than you can likely understand ."
"Had a look through this Facebook page and I don't see anything about prevention. If you want a cure donating to cancer research program is a waste of money. Cancer is the most profitable disease in the world and theres no money in the cure. There's money in treatment. The cure comes with prevention and educating yourself about what's in your water, food, air and vaccines. Once you change your diet, detoxify your body, eat organic, supplement with vitamins, minerals and other things that our body needs our bodies will have a strong immune system to fight cancer off naturally. I know  a lot of you drink bottled water or other drinks which have BPA in the plastic which is an estrogen mimicker. Too much estrogen causes hormonal problems and breast cancer. Vaccines have aluminum, adjuvants, squalene, mercury and other additives that suppress the immune system and can be a catalyst for cancer to spread. GMO veg and fruits are modified to produce there own pesticide and cause sterilization and cancer tumors in all the rats. GMO corn helps feed cancer, helps it grow and spread in your body and everything has corn syrup made with GMO corn. Come on people get off your asses and make a change in your life. Research these things yourself and get healthy. Fight to get these chemicals, pesticides and other cancer causing agents out of our food and water. Only then will you see cancer rates fall. Only you can prevent it by getting educated. I can say this because my mon passed from stage 4 lung cancer. I did a crap load of research after she passed and I wish she never had gotten chemo. Chemo is the worst thing you can do to your body. Kills your immune system and when you get it the second time your body can't fight it off. Chemo side effect is cancer. Everyone has a natural form of cancer in there body and there is things like immune suppression, and other catalysts that can cause it to get out of hand where your body can no longer fight it off. Hope this helps some of you."
"You know....I'm not the kind of person who looks for ways to cheat people out of money for my personal gain, but even if I were... I wouldn't do something like this, because I would be afraid that God would punish me by actually GIVING me whatever serious disease I claimed to have in order to con people out of their hard earned money!"
"Shameful and rude those who really have cancer"
"This makes me so angry."
"KARMA IS A BITCH!!!!! FROM A SURVIVOR."
"Horrible !!!!!!!!! Her sentence should be to work in a chemo ward for 10 years !!!!!!"
"Arrest her! I am currently fighting, and she is appalling."
"Empathy?"
"I don't feel sympathy for her. It was wrong - it was fraud and she duped people who were trying to help."
"Yes they do. The UV Lamps are the same type of light used in suntan beds. The UV (ultra violet) light penetrates the skin and may cause cancer. I've noticed that some salons are applying sunscreen just prior to putting the clients hands in the unit. This is not safe as sunscreen must be applied about 15 minutes before exposure."

"I think this is very true. Had a patient that had her nails done almost weekly. She had a spot on her thumb that after 2 months she finality went to a Dr about.  Biopsy showed melanoma, by the time she found it,  she was in the final stage with metastasis to the lung, bone,  and thyroid.  52 years young.  :/"
"That's terrible Sarah."
"So very sad Sarah Arnold! :("
"spread cancer? its not contagouis"
"Cancer will spread if the tools use for this procedure touch other organs in the abdominal cavity.  If you have uterine cancer."
"What?? Oh boy!! Never thought about that!"
"Ok let's freak us out even more, this sounds inaccurate to me.."
"I usually do the walk for hope up in Duarte, at City of Hope. This yr it's sup to be nov. 2 I think!"
"What about tubal ligations or any other obgyn procedure, if you have cancer somewhere and this tool is spreading it by touch it and other organs than couldn't ANY tool used in any procedure pose the same risk??"
"Wowww"
"They are not interested in a cure.."
"that sounds crazy but makes me glad i do not go for these kind of visits"
"Please read the article!  The photograph is 100% misleading.  None of the instruments (not tools) pictured are the problem.  They are talking about one specific instrument used in only one type of surgical procedure (done in an operating room, not in any doctor's office) and only one fairly rare type of uterine cancer.  I'm an RN who worked in surgery and for GYN oncology specialists."

Even if men can have breast cancer but it seem only women do. How can cancer or disease be sexist? It's seem that only women being target on purpose in the scam of all things that they do.

More than 1.3 millions US women had been falsely diagnose with breast cancer, only small % have life' threaten breast cancer but, media and associate had them scared and scam billions $$$$ of US citizen and government in form of advertisement, race marathon, donation, charity and grants.

Can we stopped ALS charity scam before it become the most profiting charity  scam like Breast Cancer Associations?

Breast Cancer is Sexist

In early 2012, the Susan G. Komen Foundation announced that it would be rescinding funding to Planned Parenthood; funding that had been used to provide breast cancer screenings to women with low-incomes. The group<U+2019>s claim that the decision to remove funding from Planned Parenthood was not based on the political views of Komen leadership was met with skepticism by many. Karen Handel, then senior vice president for public policy for Komen, ran on an anti-Planned Parenthood platform in her failed bid for governor of Georgia in 2010, adding fuel to the controversy.

Founder and CEO of the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Nancy Brinker, received a 64% raise in 2012, bringing along with it a salary of $684,000 a year.

<U+201C>This pay package is way outside the norm,<U+201D> said Ken Berger, CEO of Charity Navigator, an organization that evaluates charities. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s about a quarter of a million dollars more than what we see for charities of this size. <U+2026> This is more than the head of the Red Cross is making for an organization that is one-tenth the size of the Red Cross.<U+201D>

Cause Marketing

Cause marketing is when a for-profit organization teams with a non-profit charitable organization, often consisting of promotions that promise that a set percentage of proceeds on select items will go to the non-profit organization. Examples of this in the world of breast cancer include Yoplait<U+2019>s <U+201C>Save Lids to Save Lives<U+201D> campaign (Komen), the NFL<U+2019>s <U+201C>Crucial Catch<U+201D> campaign (American Cancer Society), and Kentucky Fried Chicken<U+2019>s <U+201C>Buckets for the Cure<U+201D> campaign (Komen).

like and share my page, thank you

https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1469725903290050

The goal of cause marketing is for a brand to benefit from positive public relations coverage as well as gaining the opportunity to win greater market share through cross-promotion and planting the idea in consumers<U+2019> minds that if they<U+2019>re already planning on spending money in a vertical, it might as well be with the business tied to the noble charity.

Komen<U+2019>s partnership with KFC reeked of cause dissonance. The supposed goal of this promotion was to <U+201C>save lives,<U+201D> but in reality, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in American women. One 8 piece bucket of KFC extra crispy chicken contains 2,380 calories and 160 grams of fat. Even if you split that bucket among 4 people, you<U+2019>re still looking at 595 calories (60% calories from fat) and 40 grams of fat. Additionally, the launch of the <U+201C>Buckets for the Cure<U+201D> campaign coincided with the launch of KFC<U+2019>s double-down sandwich, featuring pieces of fried chicken as the <U+201C>bread<U+201D> of the sandwich. You<U+2019>re either trying to save our lives or you<U+2019>re trying to kill us. Pick one, KFC.

Similarly, the NFL<U+2019>s <U+201C>Catch for a Cure<U+201D> campaign would be classified as cause marketing. If you turned on any of the NFL games this past weekend, you probably noticed that the fields had basically turned into a sea of pink. Players wore pink gloves, refs through pink flags, fans wore pink jerseys, and players ran towards pink first down lines. In the name of raising awareness, the NFL is doing its best to capitalize on an underrepresented demographic: women. In 2012, the NFL<U+2019>s contributions to the American Cancer Society as a result of the <U+201C>Catch for a Cure<U+201D> campaign, came in at $1.5 million. This represents 0.0188% of the NFL<U+2019>s operating revenue.

The Sexualization of Breast Cancer

Why exactly does breast cancer, above other forms of cancer, find itself the centerpiece of the cancer research/marketing field? For lack of a better way to phrase this: breasts are sexy.

<U+201C>Save the boobies!<U+201D> <U+201C>Save the ta-tas!<U+201D> <U+201C>Save Second Base!<U+201D> <U+201C>Feel Your Boobies!<U+201D>

These are all examples of actual lines organizations have used to promote breast cancer awareness. The American Cancer Society takes the cake with its own tag line: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s Okay to Look at Our Chests!<U+201D>

The sexualization of this all-too-real medical condition plays right into the classic marketing strategy of <U+201C>sex sells.<U+201D> Maybe so, but that doesn<U+2019>t make it right; and it certainly doesn<U+2019>t make it any less objectifying.

These slogans work to divide the woman, the human life at risk, from her breasts. When you say, <U+201C>save second base,<U+201D> you<U+2019>re not only playing into the idea that the value of a woman lies solely in her looks, but you<U+2019>re also suggesting that we should search for a cure for nothing else but to give men something to play with.

Breast cancer is serious, not sexy.

You don<U+2019>t see this type of marketing approach for other types of cancer. You wouldn<U+2019>t see a <U+201C>save the nuts!<U+201D> poster for testicular cancer awareness, would you? Why is it any more appropriate to say, <U+201C>save the boobies?<U+201D>

Conclusion

Do the ends justify the means? Is your hard earned money going towards the cause, or is it simply making its way to the pockets of NFL owners, yogurt conglomerates, auto dealerships and charity executives like Nancy Brinker<U+2019>s paycheck?

Breast cancer is a very real medical condition that will lead to the deaths of nearly 40,000 people this year, alone. If you<U+2019>re going to donate to this cause, I hope you do your research, find out how much of your money will be going towards research, screenings and treatment.

"A routine mammogram is exactly how a very good friend Georgina's breast cancer was found, I beg to differ this articles content :("
"I found a lump mammogram and ultrasound confirmed fine. DCIS found on other side. I am too young for routine mammograms so in 3 years I might not of been here. As mine had turned to cancer and travelled to my lymph nodes. 3 lots of surgery,chemo and radiotherapy. I am very lucky. Mammogram saved my life!!"
"Mammograms don't catch all masses when you have dense breast.... doctors don't have to disclose this to you... This can increase your risk by 6 x .  I believe in consistently checking yourself & learn your body.  Find out family history.   Best of luck to all..."
"Mine was detected through a mammo...early detection..."
"I routine mammogram found my breast cancer at stage zero so the path is so much easier than it would have been if I had not had one and waited for a larger lump to develop! Get one every year!!!"
"You HAVE to have an ultrasound too, mine wasnt found thru mammogram  GET the ultrasound too."
"A mammogram saved my life.."
"I'd be dead."
"Bull s--t!  My life was saved by a mammogram!"
"http://main.acsevents.org/site/TR?fr_id=62568&pg=personal&px=30422131    please help us reach our GOAL!! <3"
"There are different types of breastfeeding cancer. Some are only seen and some are only felt. Some are more aggressive than others. You need to have a yearly mammogram AND do monthly self breast exams. Be responsible for yourself! I  am a mammographer. I see breast cancers caught everyday in the early stages by getting yearly mammograms. There are exceptions to every case. Once again be responsible to yourself. Follow the American Cancer Society guidlines."
"I go every yr for my mammogram & they do the ultra sound I don't have cancer. I do it for myself,My mother,my aunt & grandmother that who have /had cancer."
"I've been having Mammograms done since the age of 37, but for the past four years I've had them done twice and this year I had it done three times since the beginning of the year....now they say that I might have a cancer in the nipple on my right breast. I have a cyst in the right breast for many years now and Thank God it hasn't worsen but I've been having a discharge lately with an odor....no blood and not everyday but about three or four times a week. I'm a little scared and nervous I even forgot the name she said for the type of cancer it might be but first I will have to talk to my oncologist and see the further findings with a biopsy! Im praying it's not serious! Thnk U for ""listening""."
"Everyone should get them"
"I don't care what they say. My routine mammogram has saved my life! My cancer was aggressive. Even with the routine mammograms it had gotten into the lymph nodes. Without the mammogram it would have spread throughout my body. My tumor was very deep and was very hard to feel. Don't let the insurance companies tell you you don't need yearly mammograms!"
"I thought mammography is what doctors use to look into the tissues without cutting one open? It found my grandmother's cancer ... I know it's uncomfortable, but I think I'd rather be squished than die"
"When something works ..dont try to fix it...mammograms are verrry important. ."
"Would not have found my cancer without it. Who are they trying to fool. It saved my life."
"Saved my life, wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my yearly mammogram"

When you say, <U+201C>save second base,<U+201D> you<U+2019>re not only playing into the idea that the value of a woman lies solely in her looks, but you<U+2019>re also suggesting that we should search for a cure for nothing else but to give men something to play with.

Breast cancer is serious, not sexy.

You don<U+2019>t see this type of marketing approach for other types of cancer. You wouldn<U+2019>t see a <U+201C>save the nuts!<U+201D> poster for testicular cancer awareness, would you? Why is it any more appropriate to say, <U+201C>save the boobies?<U+201D>

Conclusion

Do the ends justify the means? Is your hard earned money going towards the cause, or is it simply making its way to the pockets of NFL owners, yogurt conglomerates, auto dealerships and charity executives like Nancy Brinker<U+2019>s paycheck?

Breast cancer is a very real medical condition that will lead to the deaths of nearly 40,000 people this year, alone. If you<U+2019>re going to donate to this cause, I hope you do your research, find out how much of your money will be going towards research, screenings and treatment.

Let's quarantine anyone who does not get a flu shot because they could get the flu and spead it.... a known issue each year.  "

Thank God some one is doing something to protect the American people! Ebola might not be the easiest spread disease there is but its a nasty one and I doubt if  a child caught it they wouldn't survive like the others in America.

"lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women in the United States. In 1987, it surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer deaths in women.1

Lung cancer causes more deaths than the next three most common cancers combined (colon, breast and pancreatic). An estimated 159,260 Americans are expected to die from lung cancer in 2014, accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths.2"

"Some ppl need to grow up... I could not even tell what she was doing.. Just saw her holding her baby."
"Seriously???? :/"
"Real awsome mom thumbs up"
"This is a beautiful picture"
"No woman bring life and nourishment there is nothing offensive about it .that it's life."
"She is beautiful!  Look at the joy and contentment on her face.  How could such a serene moment be anything but beautiful?"
"It's a beautiful picture, no matter if u see anything , people need to open there eyes, there is a lot of stupid things going on in this world and no one complaints! But giving life and nourishment to your child ! Really? Get a life people"
"I'm all for breastfeeding and do so when my 5 month old is hungry. Absolutely nothing wrong with feeding your baby whether it be breast or bottle."
"Beautiful"
"I believe in covering yourself, but this pic isn't as bad as some I have seen with the whole boob just hanging out.. Feeding a baby or not you should want to be covered, I feed in private"
"So beautiful. Congratulations on the baby good luck to you three"
"The actual picture shows boob and a lot of nipple because the baby is so tiny. However I don't find it offensive and I am glad that facebook reinstated it. now if they could just clean up the pictures of the friend suggestions!"
"Nope.... love it"
"This is betauful! !"
"Absolutely not! It's a beautiful picture of someone doing something that is very natural!"
"who cares, this is how everyone was fed years ago, before formula came into the picture!"
"This country is so uptight. We can show c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bre ties that show ass tits and damn near penis for meanings of being sexual.  And you all wanna get your feathers ruffled over a natural part of human life?you all need GPS one get back on the right track cause you all are in never never land"
"There's nothing wrong with it"
"This is what is considered obscene? In the meantime, there are half naked, pornographic photos filling up facebook, that when reported, are not removed because they do not violate any rules...I call BS..."
"Why do some people always have something negative to say about everything someone post?  What's wrong with a Mother feeding her baby?   Some people  just need to get a life period."
"Answer to post: No, I wouldn't mind. Seeing the vitriol and nefarious comments and schemes by the GOP is MUCH more offensive. This photo is compassion captured. No wonder conservatives hate it!"
"Its just so crazy how ignorant people. Are. There is nothing wrong with this picture. She's feeding her miracle baby. Nothing is showing. Some people thinks that this is wrong to see on fb but its ok to post men with their pants hanging off their asses.  What is this world coming to when a mother cant feed her child without someone getting offended."
"Yes"
"Omg for real?  That's just ridiculous. There is NOTHING wrong with the pic."
"Not at all"
"Breastfeeding is a beautiful and natural thing. Saying it is wrong to see in public, would be like saying a mother or father hugging their child in public is wrong."
"Being it on Facebook what mother would let her newborn child cry when he/she is hungry"
"Beautiful picture.   God bless that baby."
"No,  I wouldn't."
"The cover picture is a beautiful moment between a mother and her nursing baby. However if you read the whole article. The picture in question (I think) is of the full breast with the baby latched on to the nipple.  Of course its natural.  But the issue I believe that Facebook has is the Breast picture. Just a thought!"
"Like"
"No, I wouldn't mind.  Breast feeding is a natural part of life.  Get your minds out of the gutter people!"
"but the torture of animals is ok.  This is fine"
"Well the picture is a bit graphic, but that's what female breasts are for. If you can't deal with that, it's time to grow up and learn to deal with it."
"These are the most beautiful photos... Giving your baby the very best start in life."
"It's not this pic that was removed...click the pic and read the article and see the pic that was.  This pic here isn't bad, however the other one, I wouldn't put it on FB if it were me.  Too personal. IMO"
"I find the Victoria's Secret ads more offensive than a breastfeeding mother."
"Ridiculous closed minded people...this is the correct way to feed . Our babies"
"What!!! It's beautiful.  It's natural for moms to feed babies.  Unreal that some fool reported it."
"There is nothing wrong with mom breastfeeding their child. People have posted worst things than that."
"if people can't handle pics like this they need to grow up and get a life!!!  how do they think all babies were fed before the invention of baby formula!!??  i would rather see pics like this rather than pics of half naked girls showing more ""boob"" than a mother does feeding her child!!!"
"Too bad your mom didn't breast feed you.
   You noe breast arts meant to use to feed baby's. So poor countries where food is scarce they feed their kids long after baby's to keep their kids alive.
   If you don't want to watch someone feeding their child click off or you can keep your head buried in the sand.
  Even Mary the Mother of Jesus had to breast feed him.
   HIS FATHER GOD gave women these to use to provide food for HIS.
   They were not made for a.man's toys to play with"
"Ag come on.......what is the problem with this picture? This is a mom feeding her child. People should get their minds out of the gutter!"
"It's natural and a God given right...but rioting in the streets you have no problem with,thinking it's the rioters right to do so..Peoples moral compasses are completely screwed up.."
"And the difference between this mom feeding her baby, and a oh so cute dog feeding her babies is??? You have to feed your kids somehow. Get over it you idiodic freaks. Why is breastfeeding even a deal? It's how you feed a child so what's the problem? What is it you guys aren't getting? Oh, it grosses you out? Yea, well just know that when you were a baby, you were sucking on the tit too!"
"Id be pissed as I am now
yhis shit shouldn't be allowed on Facebook or anywhere
its disgusting
if I wanna see a baby getting feed ill watch my own while im feeding them 
its wrong to feed during treatment"
"having a c-section and wearing tight pants hummm"
"No"
"POSTED!!! Lock me up. I extended nursed - 4yrs.  <3"
"Why not you eat your dinner anywhere you want,why then can't the baby,who is helpless eat anywhere it is given it food"
"Kiki Michele

"Breastfeeding is very important for Mums and babies, as it gives the child a better start in life and lowers the risk of breath cancer for Mum. It's being going on for forever, and new Mums shouldn't have to hide away to feed their child."
"http://teespring.com/breast-canc"
"Facebook is in all up in their asses about this beautiful bond with mother and child but they don't mind showing things about crimes committed against other humans and animals ..hmm what's up with that????  And besides this woman is NOT exposing herself...yeah its time closed minded people grew up."
"Absolutely cannot understand why ANYONE would have a problem with this. It is not as if you can see anything inappropriate. It is a beautiful picture of a mother and her baby."
"I understand that it's natural, but for myself, I wouldn't put a picture like that because I'm more of a private person with things like that. To each their own...she's not on my friends list so without the media blasting it I would have NEVER seen it. Guess she should rethink the friends on her page if that's who reported her...seems they may not be as supportive as they should be"
"Yes"
"Why would anyone be ""bothered"" by this?!!!"
"Nothing wrong in what I see myself I was done the same way by FB in the summer for posting a big bowl of blackberries makes no sense I have seen worse"
"Apparently some of you didn't open the article to see the actual picture.  I'm not against breastfeeding, but I do not need to see such a private moment between mother & child."
"Nope not a bit"
"Get over it people. The natural beauty of this is not to be criticized. (Unlike too many vulgar images I'd rather not see on FB. )"
"This is what breasts are for! Glad I got to see her special moment. So sweet."
"Really?? But no one gets 'bothered' by these stupid nasty videos girls post of themselves shaking their asses and rollin around on the floor and swinging from poles....get the f outta here...."
"For Christ's sake people! It's just a breast! Lighten up!"
"No"
"This bothers people? But profile pics of half naked girls never make this much noise? People need to get their priorities straight!!"
"Yeah. I mean really. Breastfeed in private.  Disgusting.  People get on my last nerve."
"Wow really people , get over it , a bunch of judgmental people ! Buts it's ok for half naked girls n women show more! Just WOW!!!!"
"Breast feeding is natural. I find this very beautiful. It's a bond she is sharing with her premie baby. Kudos to her for at least trying to give her baby the best possible. 

Also nudity has been sexualized by this society we live in. I am raising my boys to understand that a naked body is nothing to ogle over. It's just part of being human."
"No God made it that way a mom and baby is a beautiful thing"
"Of course NOT! This is a very natural thing!"
"This wasn't the picture that was reported. If you read the whole article it shows the pic that was reported. It also states that FB reinstated the pic after consideration and reiterated their policy on breast feeding photos. What a miracle and a beautiful moment !"
"It is a beautiful bonding moment between mother & child....WHY does it have to be shared with everyone else??? Its no longer a ""special"" bond cause you now have bonded with everyone else & strangers included on FB. And the half naked trashy pics of that are allowed are just that ""trashy pics"" that should absolutely NOT be allowed"
"Very well said Maria, just what I was going to say."
"Beautiful, it's not always but this photo has class!"
"No problem just glad it's not a 10 year old! :-)"
"I would rather see this sweet pic of a mother feeding her precious baby than pics some people post of women and their big butts! That is offensive to me!"
"Everyone needs to get their heads outta their butts! Its natural and this Lil one needs all the help it can get for being born early! This nation is so hypocritical about something so healthy. It may not be for all but stop judging women for something that's best for babies. Don't like don't look! And keep trucking. Seen the pics, but its okay for women to show their breast completely but not for a nursing mother...GET OVER IT! I SUPPORT IT <3"
"BEAUTIFUL"
"i am sick and tired of people fussing about breast feeding when miley cirus and a few others run around bare ass naked and its ok? whats wrong with that picture? both this country is really wierd aint it?"
"Most beautiful thing in the world."
"I don't care you should see the stuff people put on here. These are sweet pictures if you look at a mother breast feeding and your not thinking of Gratefulness holiness and how precious life is, then I'm afraid you are lost your mind and heart are diseased and wicked"
"No problem!"
"Nope nothing wrong to with that"
"You have up be a human to understand that special moment.  That day, that photo and the feeling of mother and child bonding will never be the same. Thank you for shareing something so special.  May your lived be forever changed !!!!"
"Can we say stupid!"
"A beautiful picture .. People need to let go and not be so uptight .. I feel bad for people who cannot accept the human body for what it is ... A body not a sex object ... We all are the same relax and find the real beauty in this photo .. A mother nursing her child ."
"What's the big deal?"
"well it is still porn.. so lets let private feeding be priovate.. women get just alil carried away to much"
"Don't mind at all.  After all this is the most natural function in the world.  Keep feeding ladies!"
"That is a beautiful picture"
"It wouldn't bother me. I've seen worse ""nudity"" photos in my news feed! People are dumb and childish"
"Carrie Decker :)"
"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1557120404520178&set=a.1557120594520159.1073741829.100006666995386&type=1&theater"
"No problem with this photo at all! It's a natural thing x"
"Are they serious? Beautiful photo <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0097>"
"Doesn't bother me one bit!  This is normal and should not offend anyone.  Precious gift of life was given to a mother and she is taking care of her child God's normal way."
"No. Not sure why this would bother anyone?"
"Everyone else posts what they're eating for dinner, lunch, breakfast... so what, the baby is eating. Judy Lynn Brown if you think this is PORN, YOU are messed up. 
Breasts were created for feeding our babies, NOT sexual purposes..."
"It's not showing anything, people need to get over it"
"FB gets weird sometimes. Congrats on your baby!"
"Are you kidding? What is wrong with this pic? Nothing. America is just full of awful people that have nothing else to do but complain about things that don't matter. Seriously get over yourselves people. There are way more pressing issues going on in the world to worry about something that does not affect you IN ANY WAY."
"...it did show up on my newsfeed or I would not have seen it...."
"Its Beautifull"
"It's not obscene but it is a private moment to be kept with family. To force it on other people is hypocritical"
"How could this possibly be obscene???  There are pre-teens taking selfies and showing a lot more than this?!?!"
"No. It's better than what I usually see"
"Beautiful photo.  I don't know why people get offended by women breastfeeding,  first off you can't even see the woman's boob, second if people see it as a sexual thing then shame on those people. Women should be able to feed their babies without being rIdiculed."
"As long as men and, more specifically, women, sexualize breasts, breast feeding in public, and on public media will be frowned upon by the general public. I'd like to see what the women who complain about not being able to breast feed in public wear normally. Do they show their cleavage... wear ""push up bras"", etc..?"
"Don't want to see this, there is the FANTASTIC idea (comes highly reccommended) to just keep scrolling past it and not looking at it :)"
"Why is it necessary to post that picture?  Want to see the baby's face. This should be private."
"God bless your baby"
"Most natural thing on earth!"
"No because breasts are not for sex they're for feeding babies"
"I think it's a beautiful moment between Mama and baby .... When I nursed I did not care who was around to see... It's a very very natural part of life.  There are more things for us as a society to care about besides this.  This is natural."
"If it was a baby calf feeding from mama cow it would get a million shares and oh so cutes! What's the diff?!"
"Nothing wrong with this pic it's Beautiful it's only a mum feeding her baby ! What is wrong with that!"
"Beautiful and natural. God bless the little one!"
"Nothing wrong with this picture..its all natural and beautiful. :)"
"Some people need to grow up"
"This is one thing that makes me mad. So what if ppl are breast feeding their baby?! It's natural and better for the baby! Share those photos all u please and don't worry about ""who"" u might offend! God knows when I have my baby, I plan to breast feed anywhere my baby is hungry! If ppl don't like it then they don't have to look! Breast feeding has always been a problem in this world. It's just as bad a these young girls taking naked or half naked selfies and their photos don't get taken down! I mean really?!? I know someone who had a baby 2 days ago and they posted pictures of their new born daughter that was naked, someone reported it!? This is just crazy!!"
"I see nothing inappropriate about this picture. She's feeding her baby."
"What is wrong with this picture?????????????"
"https://www.facebook.com/groups/775599845855221/  Help my Mother get  Reconstruction surgery after breast cancer took her breast."
"Nothing's wrong with the pic, carry on all who breastfeeding."
"I would rather see this than to see all of these whores shaking there naked asses or the Internet"
"Breast cancer if you have someone you love with brest cancer or kidney disease this movie is a must see GMO  OMG I think running a five k too support people that have cancer is great but to fight the thing and people organization causing breast cancer makes more sense."

The so called 'doctor'  (probably just some lowly first aider) has absolutely no right to refuse someone a flight he/she knows nothing about and it's not their place to have a consultation with the passenger either.

I'm a breast cancer FIGHTER.
I've never been treated so badly as I have during this time .
ITS CANCER YOU WON'T CATCH IT"
"That's pitiful."
"Look at the law suit if they let her fly and something happened, you all would be screaming at why they let her without the note...  by law anyone that is sick needs a letter to say they can handle the journey to protect the airline and passengers , friend of mine was told they needed a second letter as they can't be more then 5days old anything can happen to your health in that time she did the right thing went to the hotel dr he gave her a new note after the check up ..... think before going off two sides to every story"

A woman who's malnourished to the point of cancer is not a soldier. She is not automatically a candidate for sainthood. She is ignorant and ignorance exacts a toll. Surviving a train wreck isn't an act of bravery. Cancer is a measurable, easily explainable, regional, dietary disease. No one is afflicted with cancer as a turn of bad luck, for smoking cigarettes, or for having a cancer-stricken family. What makes regional? Diet. Diets are regional as they are traditional. The missing dietary factor is Amygdalin (vitamin B17)."

""Vitamin B17 as the Cure for Cancer""

In the 1950s biochemist Dr. Ernst T. Krebs, Jr. isolated a substance that he designated vitamin B17 (a.k.a. Amygdalin). It started when he studied the habits of the tribe of the Hunza. In their culture cancer or tumors are unknown. They lived in what they called the""<U+2018>Kingdom of the Apricots."" Apricots are part of their main food, but they did not eat the fruit only, they also ate the kernels. Dr. Krebs isolated a substance in these kernels, which he named vitamin B17 and research confirmed that, once the body receives 50 to 75 m.g. of  vitamin B17 per day, it penetrates the membrane of cancerous cells and destroys these. B17 is in fact a cyanogenic glycoside, an anti-neoplastic substance, i.e. it destroys tumor cells. It also contains benzaldehyde, which is a powerful pain killer. Healthy cells contain the enzyme rhodanese, which blocks B17 from entering a healthy cell. Cancerous cells do not have this protective enzyme, so B17 can easily enter cancer cells and destroys them.

B17 (or laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips) is also present in macadamia nuts, millet, kernels of peaches, nectarines, cherries and plums.
Dr. Krebs presented his discoveries to the Second Annual Cancer Convention in Los Angeles in 1974. Since this discovery, millions of cancer patients could be cured in an inexpensive but very effective way.

However, in the U.S. $11 Billion (U.S.) are spend annually on <U+2018>conventional<U+2019> cancer treatments: chemo, surgery cryo-ablation (freezing) and radiation.

Dr. Earl Mindell writes in his Vitamin Bible (1982) ""Vitamin B17 touted as a cancer treatment in most of the United States at this date and legal in fifteen states but rejected by the Food and Drug Administration on the grounds that it might be poisonous due to its cyanide content...A deficiency may lead to diminished resistance to cancer."""

<U+201C>Therapeutic<U+201D> radiation, in any amount, harms living tissue. (Roentgen rays, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, x-radiation, ionizing radiation, corpuscular radiation can be implemented for diagnostic purposes, but never for therapeutic benefit.) Chemo- <U+201C>therapy<U+201D> poisons healthy tissue [necrocytotoxin <U+2013> a toxin that produces death of cells]. Of the 4 protocols in traditional (allopathic) cancer <U+201C>therapy<U+201D>: surgery (cutting), radiation (burning), cryo-ablation/cryosurgery (hypothermia) & chemo/chemical (poisoning/toxifying), only manual surgery possesses some legitimacy when malignant (cancerous) growth has reached a certain stage. It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress. A person whose<U+FEFF> diet is deficient in these nitrilosidic foods (those foods rich in Amygdalin, the substance of which the molecularity is 1 part: the natural analgesic<U+FEFF> benzaldehyde, 1 part: hydrogen cyanide, 2 parts: glucose) is incapable of stopping the over-production<U+FEFF> of healing cells<U+FEFF> thus this person has cancer. To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya. Supplement your diet with the nutrients (of which 95% of Americans are chronically deficient) that compliment Laetrile (vitamin B17):  <U+2460> zinc (which is the transport mechanism for Laetrile/vitamin B17) <U+2461> vitamin C (build up to 6 grams a day) <U+2462><U+FEFF> manganese <U+2463> magnesium <U+2464> selenium <U+2465> vitamins B6, B9 & B12 <U+2466> vitamin A <U+2467> vitamin E (at least 2,000 I.U.)

IN BRIEF Concerning Cancer: 1. Take a pregnancy test just after waking up. For men a positive result means either cancer or a false positive. Take another test the next day. If a man gets 3 positive results then likely he has cancer somewhere. For women a positive result means (if she's able to become pregnant) she's pregnant or she has cancer, or she's pregnant and she has cancer, or a false positive (the test result is wrong). 

2. Several positive pregnancy test results = cancer. What next? STOP eating red meat, sugar, corn syrup. STOP drinking booze. STOP (or at least cut back on) smoking.

3. Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. Take vitamin B17 (at least 1 gram daily) and wheat grass and/or barley grass liquid or capsules (they're rich in vitamin B17), on a full stomach daily (you can't overdose on them ~ they're not poisonous). Take a zinc supplement. Take pancreatic enzymes.  

Since 2009 I have ordered vitamin B17 from Metabolic Products in California. 500 m.g. costs 87 cents. My mother is 79. She's been taking a gram per day for a year. Her pregnancy tests were positive in June 2013. They're negative now. I told her that she could cut her daily dose of vitamin B17 from 1,000 m.g. to 100 m.g. now that she's cancer-free but she insists on taking the high dose as it's made her fingernails harder and her hair thicker.

REVIEW: TAKE pregnancy tests to detect cancer. TAKE vitamin B17 (and as many of the listed vitamins as you can, especially zinc). Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. STOP eating red meat & cane sugar. It will take several weeks on B17 therapy to turn out negative pregnancy test results. The tumor WILL NOT shrink much even after the cancer is gone because only 10% of the tumor was cancer. The tumor MAY swell temporarily as the vitamin B17 kills malignant cells.

NOTE: Vitamin B17 therapy WILL NOT destroy the tumor! Vitamin B17 therapy will destroy the malignant cells (cancerous cells) of the tumor and within the tumor. Only 5% to 10% of the cells comprising a tumor are cancerous cells. In time the tumorous growth will be absorbed, in whole or in part. Unless the tumor is cosmetically displeasing, impinging nerves or blood vessels or hampering normal bodily function then let it be.

"CANCER IS A VITAMIN-DEFICIENCY DISEASE by Richard Thripp: HOW TO CURE IT: DO NOT SUBMIT TO RADIO- & CRYO-ABLATIVE & CHEMO- <U+201C>THERAPIES<U+201D> <U+2014> TAKE PANCREATIC ENZYMES <U+2014> AVOID CERTAIN FOODS & HABITS <U+2014> TAKE VITAMIN B17 (1 to 6 grams daily on a full stomach) AND THE VITAMINS LISTED BELOW <U+2014> EAT THE FOODS LISTED BELOW <U+2014>

<U+201C>Therapeutic<U+201D> radiation, in any amount, harms living tissue. (Roentgen rays, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, x-radiation, ionizing radiation, corpuscular radiation can be implemented for diagnostic purposes, but never for therapeutic benefit.) Chemo- <U+201C>therapy<U+201D> poisons healthy tissue [necrocytotoxin <U+2013> a toxin that produces death of cells]. Of the 4 protocols in traditional (allopathic) cancer <U+201C>therapy<U+201D>: surgery (cutting), radiation (burning), cryo-ablation/cryosurgery (hypothermia) & chemo/chemical (poisoning/toxifying), only manual surgery possesses some legitimacy when malignant (cancerous) growth has reached a certain stage. It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress. A person whose<U+FEFF> diet is deficient in these nitrilosidic foods (those foods rich in Amygdalin, the substance of which the molecularity is 1 part: the natural analgesic<U+FEFF> benzaldehyde, 1 part: hydrogen cyanide, 2 parts: glucose) is incapable of stopping the over-production<U+FEFF> of healing cells<U+FEFF> thus this person has cancer. To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya. Supplement your diet with the nutrients (of which 95% of Americans are chronically deficient) that compliment Laetrile (vitamin B17):  <U+2460> zinc (which is the transport mechanism for Laetrile/vitamin B17) <U+2461> vitamin C (build up to 6 grams a day) <U+2462><U+FEFF> manganese <U+2463> magnesium <U+2464> selenium <U+2465> vitamins B6, B9 & B12 <U+2466> vitamin A <U+2467> vitamin E (at least 2,000 I.U.)

A cheap, over-the-counter, urine-analysis pregnancy test is accurate in 92% of cases at detecting cancerous cell activity in the body. Men & women can test for cancer upon rising with a pregnancy test as cancer and pre-embryonic cells are virtually indistinguishable (in functionality) from cells designated as: adenocarcinomic, ameboid, anaplastic, angiogenetic, angiogenic, astrocytomal, atypical, basal, blastocystic, cacoethic, cancerial, cancerian, cancerigenic, cancerigenical, cancerogenic, cancerogenical, cancroidal, cankerous, carcinoembryonic, carcinogenic, carcinogenical, carcinoidal, carcinomal, carcinomatoid, carcinomatous, carcinomic, carcinosarcomal, cholangiocarcinomal, dedifferentiated, dysplastic, embryonal, embryonical, endometrial, endophytic, epithelial, epitheliomatous, endophytic, exophytic, extra-embryonic,  fibroblastic, gestational, glioblastomal, hypermutable, hypermutagenic, leucaemicus, leukaemic, leukaemical, leukemic, leukemical, liposarcomal, lymphomal, lymphomic, macroglobulinemiac, malignant, malignantal, malignantic, malignus, melanocytic, melanomatous, melanotic, metastatic, metastatical, M<U+00FC>llerian, mutagenic, mutagenical, mutated, mutational, mycoplasmal, mycoplasmic, myelodysplastic, myelodysplastical, myelomal, myelomatoid, myelomonocytic, myelomonocytical, myeloproliferative, myxoid, myxoidic, necrogenic, necrogenous, neo-blastic, neo-embryonic, neo-fetal, neo-genetic, neo-genetical, neo-plasiac, neo-plasmic, neo-plastic, neo-plastigenic, odontogenic, oncogenic, oncologic, oncological, paraneoplastic, paraneoplastical, paraneoplastical, pathogenetic, pathogenetical, pathogenic, pathogenical, placental, placentational, pleiomorphic, pleomorphic, polymorphic, polymorphical, pluripotent, pre-cancerous, pre-embryonal, pre-leukemic, promyelocytic, promyelocytical, proto-embryonic, proto-leukemic, pre-squamous, proto-oncogenetic (gene), proto-tumorous, quasi-neoplastic, sarcomal, sarcomatous, squamous, trophic, trophical, trophoblastic, trophoblastical, trophoplasmatic, trophoplasmic, tumefactive, tumefied, tumid, tumoral, tumorigenic, tumorlike, tumorous. Watch (available on You-Tube) G. Edward Griffin's ""World Without Cancer.""

IN BRIEF Concerning Cancer: 1. Take a pregnancy test just after waking up. For men a positive result means either cancer or a false positive. Take another test the next day. If a man gets 3 positive results then likely he has cancer somewhere. For women a positive result means (if she's able to become pregnant) she's pregnant or she has cancer, or she's pregnant and she has cancer, or a false positive (the test result is wrong). 

2. Several positive pregnancy test results = cancer. What next? STOP eating red meat, sugar, corn syrup. STOP drinking booze. STOP (or at least cut back on) smoking.

3. Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. Take vitamin B17 (at least 1 gram daily) and wheat grass and/or barley grass liquid or capsules (they're rich in vitamin B17), on a full stomach daily (you can't overdose on them ~ they're not poisonous). Take a zinc supplement. Take pancreatic enzymes.  

Since 2009 I have ordered vitamin B17 from Metabolic Products in California. 500 m.g. costs 87 cents. My mother is 79. She's been taking a gram per day for a year. Her pregnancy tests were positive in June 2013. They're negative now. I told her that she could cut her daily dose of vitamin B17 from 1,000 m.g. to 100 m.g. now that she's cancer-free but she insists on taking the high dose as it's made her fingernails harder and her hair thicker.

Resveratrol & prevention of cancer

Second to heart disease, Cancer as a leading cause of death, is speculated to be the number-one cause of death worldwide by 2010. However, in various studies reviewed by the National Institute of Health, leading researchers found that Resveratrol inhibits the growth of many types of cancer cells, including leukemia, skin and prostate cancers, and reduces the incidence of tumors.

"Well 6 rounds of chemo and 3/of those was red devil. And 33/rounds of radiation and 3 breast operation double,full reconstruction. Then fluid filled behind them and another operation. Made 3 times, and all my lymnnodes removed from right. Stage and grade 3. Then cancer free for 4 years
Now return I have metastatic cancer in my bones chest and lymnnodes and spine. 2 years or less to live so nope my 3 breast surgery doesn't look or feel great. And have stage 4 doesn't either"
"Actually, I'm not celebrating having had cancer and surgery but my body is indeed a better shape overall, albeit I'm missing a nipple."
"Prayers going out to all survivors and fighters, I am a miracle of God, I had to much medication for my system one night and went into an altered state so they did an MRI and found holes in my skull while checking to see if I had suffered a stroke. After finding them they thought it was Multiple Myeloma that had traveled from soft tissue, so they did a Mammogram and found a small suspicious area. They did a biopsy and found Ductal Carcinoma the non aggressive type so they did a lumpectomy. When they examined the lump it was free of cancer and so were my lymph nodes, I claim a miracle of God that they took it all in the biopsy in 2012 going for Mammograms this month but so far 3 years breast cancer free. The only thing is the holes in the skull are larger but not by a lot they will do a biopsy this month of the skull and scans of all my bones. It's an ongoing job to keep on top of any and all symptoms when we are survivors but it becomes routine. God Bless my sisters and brothers breast cancer survivors."

"I live in the US, and had my first PAP at 16.  I've had one every year since."
"here in australia you starting getting pap smears when you become sexually active, your doctor has your records, and will remind you its due. you can also register to have a reminder sent to you by mail or email. i can't believe there is an age limit on this anywhere, especially when you are having problems like this young lady. her doctor should be sued, won't bring Emma back but her doctor would never be in a position to do this to another woman again."
"Once I turned 18, it was in the recommended once a year list. How are you too young for a Pap smear?"
"This last pregnancy I wasn't given a pelvic exam until I practically demanded it. 
I trust my doctors, but no one will look out for you better than you! 
Make. Them. Test. You. 
Get a second opinion, if needed."
"i had my first pap at 16....my niece had one since she was 16..at 19 she changed doctors because of the pain she was in and he kept telling her it was the begininigs of endometriosis...and giving her pain pills and doing nothing..her mom made her switch docs...she had cervical cancer..stage 2...either the lab was wrong for years or the doc simply could not read the reports...smh...she is fine and dandy now...but had a scrape and then later a freeze...and finally had one child, after being told becaue of the freeze that may never happen....my oldest niece was older in her early 50's, had a pap...didnt call the doc back for the results..thought he would call...starting having issues  a year later..went back..they told her then she had cancer and was supposed to have called them back...too later for her..it had spread everywhere..she was lost to us....smh...over a phone call.....how can u be too young???? but in the UK, its state run medical services...my friends from there tell me its a horror trying to get anything done...and it is not simple to change doctors....smh...sad"
"At 16 I found out I had a mass on my ovarie and they took it out when I was 18 and I had to wait til I was 21 to get a pap done. And I have to wait til I'm 39 to get a mammogram even though my mom is a survivor of breast cancer, all because my insurance doesn't cover it til then."
"Really sad story ! Prevention or finding out the early stage , is what you can do best ! If your doctor is ignorant & careless , to simply test you , don't hesitate , go find another one ! cancer has no age barriers ...."
"Allison on my last yearly I was told they no longer due Pap smear yearly unless there are markers that require it. I was like huh? I had breast cancer I want a Pap smear he said in sorry everything is normal according to your guideline again huh? I pay an exuberant amount of money for health insurance give me the damn test!"
"I started having paps regularly at 16,  shortly after starting birth control. I had one annually until i was 21 when i began having them biannually. I thought this was standard practice for every breeding age woman, i guess i was just lucky to have a decent doctor."
"So sad. We women need to stand up and demand to change the laws on Cancer. Even at 16 yrs old, it is better than what USA is!"

Having my sister diagnosed with Breast cancer and a cousin diagnosed with Thyroid cancer all before the age of 35 has changed the playing field. Ladies ..please get checked and find a doctor who will listen and care. <3"
"I guess they don't get birth control until they are 25 either???"
"had my 1st one at 21, if you are having problems you should be able to get tests that are needed, this should have nothing to do with age"
"How can you put an age on cancer?????  Something must change"
"I was nervous at my very first, but went anyway, and since then have been in and out due to issues with my cervix, if i had left it for years then I'd no doubt be dead by now. Every time a friend tells me they didn't go I tell them horror stories of when people don't, and my luck that i went. Ice underwent 2 treatments so far and awaiting more. I'm lucky, never tempt fate ladiesa"
"You should have your first Pap, when you become sexually active, regardless of your age...."
"Breast Cancer

Checking your breasts regularly
Upper chest and armpits too,
Is crucial to early diagnosis
Know what is normal to you.

Lumps, thickening of breast tissue
One breast becomes larger or lower,
Make sure you attend breast screening
If you are seventy or over?

Everyone<U+2019>s breasts are different
Different times of the month and age,
Lookout for changes unusual to you
If worried? GP please engage.

Puckering or dimpling of the skin
Continuous pain causing strife,
Reporting changes without delay
Can make a difference to your life.

Have your nipples inverted (turned in)?
Have they changed shape or position?
Developing a rash, crusting or discharge
If any of these? It<U+2019>s your mission.

Make an appointment with your GP
Remember this is your body,
Early diagnosis can make a difference
Better to be safe than sorry.

"Why God let this thing happens to women? So heartbreaking."
"So sad that a life was cut too short because of the medical field and their almost lack of knowledge when it comes to women and our health. 
I was told last year that a pap only needs to be done every 3 years now unless you have an abnormal one. 
I still request it yearly but they ""frown"" upon the request and try to talk me out of it. I have to tell them exactly what tests to order bc I've had them not order the pap or certain screenings only to have to go through it again so they get it right. And this is in the US."
"so sad RIP Emma x"
"Sad sorry."
"While there are some exams that have age requirements, if a person is having issues and will benefit from having the test done early, the doctor can order it.  I know it's done all the time in the U.S. with mammograms and colonoscopies and it doesn't make sense not to administer a potentially life saving exam because of an unreliable age requirement."
"...but I got asked if i needed one when I was only 16...and I didnt even have anything wrong with me (it was a check up)....."
"Very sad."

"Cancer does not discriminate."

"in Australia the test is available from 16yrs old"
"they need to bring the age down to at leased 20 to many young women are dieing when they could be saved ,."
"That's not true."
"It's the insurance companies putting the age requirements on the test not the dr's. I totally agree it is bull."
":("
"Wow. The U.K. needs to get with the program. No routine paps until 25??   Started mine at 16 too (the U.S.).   And scary that there is talk about not needing them annually anymore.  We all need to request, or demand, them annually.  Such a sad story"
"Sad."
"Meri Harris Renfroe"
"This women sounds crazy!  This is a great book with historical significance.  Maybe she should stay with Dr. Suess."
"This is history.. This book and the significant person it;s base on it the reson so many cancers are cured, diagnosed early. I didn't learn about this book until I entered the Nursing program a few years ago and was floored. Wow!! This needs to be a book that is a required read in High school."

"I'm 23 and I had a papsmear at the end of last year and I was 22  the outcome was normal but last week I wasn't feeling right so I asked for one and I was refused feeling frustrated I went back and demanded one and yes it has come back abnormal (precancerous cells)  but the point is NO Dr should refuse you no matter what age you are. I think that the importance of having regular papsmears should be encouraged alot more also."

"IMO stuff  like this are fab"
"I discovered my own breast cancer.  I told my breast surgeon specialised in breast cancer on my annual visit i feel a lump, he didn't even hear me... Then the results of my mamogram came back to be followed up with ultrasound.  That was July 2013, stage one.  I am blessed and grateful ... I am cancer free."
"I'm going today at 1:45 to have my mammogram. I lost my Mom on Oct. 13th, 2008 to breast cancer."
"Having had some permanent  left side paralysis, I had to become my own advocate. In that I could not do a proper self exam on my right side with my left OR right hand so I probably had my first true mammogram before my 30's....  When you are married   and the doctor says ""Have your husband  help you. LOL Yea right He thinks they are TOYS!!!""  Unfortunately I have had to rely strictly on extensive mammogram films and a needle biopsy(left side) to surgically remove  a ""lump"" and then the    ""wait"" to determine if it's benign..   Once I  found out it was all I could do was look up and say  ""Thank You"" and text  ""PTL""  to people I had  been keeping updated. I know I was blessed that it was not cancerous or malignant and did not have to go through radiation or chemo......."
"For the entire month of October my company is offering this Breast Self Examination kit as a Buy One Get One FREE.  Free is good.  Contact me to obtain your Breast Chek Kit and get an extra to give to a loved one.  Breast self examination is the key to preventing breast cancer."
"My sister is a survivor but I have lost people I loved to breast cancer. And friends have suffered terribly. We should be spending a hell of a lot more on cancer cures."
"I am a believer in disagreeing when something doesn't feel right.  2 weeks before I was to turn 40, I  had my annual exam.  My Doc didn't want to do a mammogram beause I hadn't reached 40 yet.  I begged to differ and thank goodness I did.  After the mammogram came the ultrasound, then the mri then the many biopsies.  Then came the lumpectomy with a diagnosis of ALH.  Thank goodness I insisted to take control of my health and well being.  Always listen to your senses, as you know your body better than anyone.....even your doctor."
"Don't ever listen when a doctor says it wont grow are it will go away I was 21 when I found a lump pregnant with my daughter and he told me it wouldn't grow.I carried it for 6 years and I notice it growing but didn't think of it to talk to another doctor until I had a physical with a girl doctor she sent me back to a breast care facility and found out after they removed it was a size of a grapefruit.These doctors did test on it wasn't cancer but the doctor told me if I left it go any longer it could have been.So never over look a lump just because a doctors says its fine."
"Dont ever tell yourself you are too young or have no family Hx....I saw it too many times!!!  Check yourself and get your mammograms!!!!!"
"Oh! And one of the major things that Planned Parenthood does is provide cancer screenings. Yet, there are those who would make it a political football to be kicked around and ended. That makes no sense. Speak up for women! Speak up for all the good that Planned Parenthood does!"

"My friend does 3d nipple tattoos and now just patented the first silicone nipple microdermal implant. It's amazing. And better than that his ultimate goal is to be able to do these FREE to women that need them.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_gBaULwpQ"

"It is so sad to watch anyone go through any type of cancer. There is so much you want to do for them but in the end all you can do is be there and comfort them until the end.

"No I do not believe this.  I know someone who was very skinny and she died from breast cancer.  I think there are many factors in who may or may not develop breast cancer."
"BS"
"As another reader pointed out,  ""Over a 10-year period, and from brand to brand, the waist circumference of a size 12 is not a constant, and therefore not a useful proxy.""  I've seen studies stating similar cause and effect on skirt lengths and the stock market -- equally flawed. If this article is meant to say that exercise and diet could play a big part in breast cancer, ok. But to relate it to something as changeable as a SKIRT SIZE??  Nuts!  AND ... I believe it's more harmful to drive on an interstate freeway, or one like the M5 in the UK and inhale those car toxins than it is to get a bit of tummy over the years!  External, environmental causation of BC is rarely discussed, it is ALWAYS some kind of ""blame the woman"" gambit, such as this.  It's NOT helpful - its quite the reverse."

"I'm a month  out from by bi lateral  mastectomy.  Had major dcis in the left breast and invasive  cancer in the right breast that I didn't  even know was there until  the pathology  report.  Thank  goodness i choose  to  take both because  now I'm cancer free! The day I was diagnosed  I just made up my mind right there that this little thing called cancer wasn't going to  stop me. I'm a fighter, I am a winner!"
"I remember that day so well. I had been screened for breast cancer early on because of the strong family history on my mom's side. I go back now and read my journal which I started the day after. Had a 2 pronged tumor and they did not know if the cancer cells were already out there in other areas. So the week after were full of many tests and dr. visits. It had not gone out anywhere else but did go to my lymph nodes under my right arm. After 3 surgeries and treatments I am now going into my 7th cancer free year! My husband was with me when I was told and I kind of remember that my mind wen black and could not respond for awhile. My surgeon and his nurses took great care of me and I remember coming home and letting the tears outt. I felt like I was looking at things through different eyes. Many emotions but had to concentrate on what was ahead of me and am blessed with a very supportive husband, friends and people who became my friends through those years. I am a very open person and hoped I could help others who walked or who are walking this same path. Bless you all!"
"Went for my Mammogram at Breast Care the Dr showed me the lump, had a biopsy in the office I went to the car with my husband and cried three days later it was confirmed.  After a mastectomy we have only looked forward that was 17 years ago."
"I went numb. I knew before the biopsy it was cancer. I cried &  told my husband I didn't want to die. Gathered strength & never looked back!"
"Its one year ago this month I was in a State of Shock wen I found out completely no emotions until the radiation than Major DEpression set in.I'm ok now and look forward to the future.........."
"Please find a cure for Metastatic Breast cancer!"
"I knew from seeing my condition on Web MD. So I went to my Gyn and went thru testing. Radiologist freaked out when I told him I was going to Vegas that weekend. My sister Denise and I took a long time trying to decide on date when we could get our schedules co ordinated for a Vegas trip. I also knew what my dad went thru back in '81. May as well go and enjoy myself while I can.  And I did- best time with my best friend. Breast cancer was a mass and I had a 40% chance of survival.( Better than 30%)  2X survivor (it metasis to my brain) Terminal diagnosis."
"I went totally numb and couldn't breathe. The breath that that doctor took before telling me ""the good news is that it's treatable"" felt like an absolute eternity. Its 2 years since my diagnosis."
"It happened to me twice in 10 yrs.2nd time a masectomy on my left breast. I am happy where I am in remission. Every six months, I get nervous before dr's apptmnt. Still positive."
"I went for a base line mammogram at 35 expecting to walk out and not returning for 5 years. I knew there was a problem when the technician kept on coming back about 3 times to get a closer picture. Finally went into doctors office and she told me I had breast cancer. I walked out of office totally numb. I was since diagnosed at age 39 and 44. I currently a very healthy 57 year old<ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BE><U+0080>"
"I was told 22 1/2 years ago at the age of 33 that I had breast cancer! I remember it like it was yesterday.........I was told the results were in and I had to go to the office. When I was told it was Cancer, I went totally numb, blank and scared to death! I have been Cancer Free for 22 1/2 years and Loving Life!"
"""You have cancer,"" said my GYN. I know she said a lot more. Thank goodness my hubby was sitting right next to me listening to what she went on too say. Still don't remember what else my GYN said after ""you have cancer"" but this I do....Beeeeeeeeeeeeeppppppppppppppppppppppppppp, is all  I heard till we got to our car in the parking lot of her office.

"Once I had the biopsy I think I knew deep down it was cancer.  The confirmation phone call wasn't very shocking but I do remember not being able to breathe."
"I'm adopted.  So didn't know any history.   Went for a routine mammogram. In one year there was the lump.    I was lucky found it fairly early.   Lumpectomy and two more surgeries.      14 years still going strong."
"I had to fight for a biopsy, the first Doctor said they do not do cyst. When I did get some one to listen my biopsy looked like ice tea. That is when I knew I had breast cancer. When the Doctor called and said to come in I was ready for the news. My husband was not or my children. I made a choice that I was going to fight. Always go for second append. It saved my life. I pray for all of you, God Bless"
"Shock, I think, was the first feeling. There were no symptoms, no signs. It was found through a biopsy. I was very fortunate, and very Blessed, through my diagnosis and treatment, but it sure was an eye opener and a life changer."
"I was in a meeting and phone was turned off.  When we came out. I returned the call, the silly young receptionist was annoyed that I was asking to speak to the doctor or her nurse and told me that they had set up an appointment with the surgeon! Talk about shock, I hadn't even known it was positive!!  The doc called and apologized later. Fortunately, we caught it early and a lumpectomy was in the cards for me.  That was 4 years ago,  2011."
"When I went to the doc's after finding a lump, she teared up. Uh oh. Then when the pathologist said ""considerable carcinoma"" during my ultrasound, I replied, ""you just said a bad word"". She took my hand and told me there was no easy way to say the bad word. I started to shake uncontrollably. Now, eleven years cancer free!"

"Thanks  for the info :p"
"I have been tested. I am chek2 positive. The found cancer in my right breast. I am scheduled for a double mastectomy on October 20th. It's scary. Thinking more for my little girl and other in the family."
"Mom, grandma, aunt and cousin all had BC.  I had brac1 which was negative. Afterwards had mammogram which came up clear but I insisted on a breast ultrasound and found stage 1 Hormone positive.   Had bilateral mastectomy in dec.  had an infection which stopped me from any implant reconstruction.   Insist on every test available.  If you hear no, dispute it or pay for the ultrasound yourself    $179 is worth your life."
"I had it done  cause cancer  runs in my  dad's side of the  family  and mine came back   negative  thank god my dad passed away  from  breast cancer and  his mom and  his aunt"
"I had the BRCA testing done..... for my 2, 40 ish girls. The test was negative for the gene.  It gave  me and my girls peace of mind.  Yes, they may get breast cancer, but it won't be inherited from me."
"I am BRCA negative.. But I had a mastectomy for a phyllodes tumor and a hysterectomy..My mom passed with stage 4 breast cancer at 53."
"I would love to be tested cause my dad's mom is the survivor of (Breast) cancer on both sides of my family (we have leukemia, and 3 different types of cancer in my family that both my grandpas, my cousin, & Aunt died from). Unfortunately Military insurance won't cover the testing unless my parents or sibling/s have had it. I'm an only child & my dad died from another horrible heriditary disease."
"I had it done I was brac 1 positive my mom had breast and ovarian cancer..she   has since passed. I would recommend to have it done. I chose double mastectomy and I had a 21 cm tumor on my ovary and had a total  hysterectomy."
"I had it done for my daughter's sake. I found out I do not carry the gene.   I forgot to previously mention that I had undergone treatment last year for breat cancer."
"I got tested for my half sisters sake. Negative....it was environmental. I would definitely do it again and if I were in the other shoes I would want to know and if it would happen to be positive I would be very proactive and take whatever measures needed to keep me from chemotherapy. Chemotherapy saved my life but I would avoid it at all costs if given the chance. It's been six years and I still have side effects. And I only had cancer in one breast but was proactive and had a double mastectomy and silicone implants. I am not the same person I once was but have never regretted the decision."
"I had the gene test when I was 20 and I had the gene brac1 and brac2 so couple months later I was scheduled for a double mastectomy was a very hard decision but having my 2 year old daughter at that time is what made me do it as I did not want her not knowing me as my mum passed away when I was 5 and she was 25 a young woman herself. I have just had the ovaries removed last year and I could do that as have 2 gorgeous daughter I now worry about them aged 13 and 7 as I don't want them to worry about anything like this x they will be gene checked in time x"
"If your a DES daughter your at higher risk for breast and other cancers and health issues. Google DES daughter a good read. Anyone born 1938-1971 should research this. Most Doctors don't ask either"
"I was tested 6 years ago. It was negative. However, the genetic specialist advised me there may be other genes that are unknown that may be a contributing factor as well. This is very scary since I have a daughter who is now 13."

"It is peace of mind to know if you have the gene or not."
"I was tested for myself and for my daughter.  Tested negative."
"Of course    Why would you not have the test done?!?  I did it for my daughter and my granddaughter."

"TLC products Vs #Cancer! Testimony By Armand Puyolt 

First #Armand Puyolt has an awesome Testimonial about IASO #Gano, IASO #Chaga, IASO #Nutraburst and IASO #Techui which helped him to battle with Cancer. Today 5 Years later he is still cancer free having not had Chemo. Secondly, as long as their doctor says they can eat they can take IASO Gano, IASO Chaga and IASO Techui. Heavy Doses 4 -5 A Day. The active anti-cancer constituents in Ganoderma Luiciden are called Beta-D-glucan.
 Beta-D-glucan is a polysaccharide basically a huge sugar molecule made up of many little sugar molecules chained together bound to amino acids. These intricate sugars stimulate or modulate the immune system by activating immune cells such as macrophage and helper T-cells, as well as increase the immunoglobin levels (immunoglobins are specific types of antibodies) to produce a heightened response to foreign cells, whether bacteria, viruses, or tumor cells. Documented by:Morishige, Fukumi, 1987. Chinese Traditional Medicine Part III, Page 12 - 23, ISBN4-88580-053-6 C-0077. The Chaga plant has been documented to destroy cancer cells in your body. It is a POSITVE parasite. It litereally eats the negative in your body getting rid of what is not suppose to be there. Think of it as Destroyer of illness at that very moment. Chaga grabs it, destroys it, and will prevent it at will.

"The Budwig anti cancer diet is fascinating. it's a healthy diet to fight cancer and this little heard of German doctor should not be overlooked. x"
"ALL Facebook cancer sites are pity parties. People are beat down by a disease that afflicted 3% of the American citizenry in A.D. 1900 to a projected 50% by year 2020. A fact that few people know: a cancer patient who dies from an opportunistic infection during immunologically-suppressive chemico-/radio-/cryo-ablative ""therapies"" is statistically a cancer-treatment success story. Currently cardiovascular disease & cancer alternate as #1 & #2 in regards to leading causes of death. Unsurprisingly, folks who succumb to heart attacks, aneurysms & strokes had cancer while those who died of cancer were cardiac patients taking prescribed blood thinners & statins. It's a mad dash to the grave between these 2 diseases of malnutrition."
"We pray for knowledge & guidance rather than a divine suspension of physical law. The Creator provides in His bounty the cures for diseases. The cure for crab cancer is found within fruit seeds (except American citrus), brown rice, bitter almonds (not sweet almonds) etc. NO DISEASE is cured by hypothermic gradation, toxication, mutilation, ablation, extirpation or irradiation."

"WEB: ""The Army Tested Chemicals on Residents of Poor, Black St. Louis Neighborhoods in The 1950s"" ~ In the early 1950s, the army set up motorized blowers on top of residential high-rises in low-income, mostly black St. Louis neighborhoods, including areas where as much as 70% of the residents were children under 12. The government told residents that it was experimenting with a smokescreen to protect the city from Russian attacks, but it was actually pumping the air full of hundreds of pounds of finely powdered zinc cadmium sulfide. The government admits that there was a second ingredient in the chemical powder, but whether or not that ingredient was radioactive remains classified. Of course it does."

"my wife when through 10 different surgery ,  an several in office biopsies an in hospital biopsies,  i truely can't believe how strong women are,  you'll do fine gayle   keep up the good work ."
"Lumpectomy, double mastectomy with reconstruction, infection, complications, 5 surgeries, 10 years of oral chemo. 2 year survivor. I love the pink! In my opinion, the going bra less day was taken out of context. I believe it was meant to send a message ""take of the bra and get a mammogram"". I can't be bitter. I fought. I won. How can one be bitter because you SURVIVED the hell that breast cancer brings? 

In the month of October I make a facebook post everyday with a reminder for women to get a mammogram. The post usually has a picture, or a story or something educational. But it works. Friends and family get their mammograms and post their good or bad results. A friend sent me a message, and I quote, ""Thank you for reminding me to get a mammogram. I always thought  you were an inspiration. I just never knew it would be for me. Now my cancer journey begins"".  So remember ladies and gentlemen, just one reminder equals a mammogram equals early detection equals a life saved.  Life is short. Pink it up!"
"I hate October- all those cute pink things that people are throwing away their money on. What's wrong with just donating to cancer organizations of your choice where the money goes to research and not the manufacture of junk or to administrative costs. I had a double mastectomy - no bra day is irrelevant to me."
"Thanks... Well said! I'm sure all those bra less woman .. Have no idea.. What real survivors have been through!"
"I'm a survivor and have had a total of 32 surgeries in the past 5 years due to various complications.  If wearing no bra, wearing pink, or watching football players wear pink makes someone smile then I say do it.  Not every survivor has anger issues.  Lighten up ladies and have some fun!!!"
"Lumpectomy, radiation, Tamoxifen, recurrence, bilateral mastectomy, no reconstruction, scar revision, hysterectomy..... Thank you to those who made donations that made a difference and thank you to those who kept their bras on on the 13th."
"I'm a breast cancer survivor and I think the no bra day is absolutely insulting and ridiculous!!"
"Lumpectomy , radiation , 7 year survivor ."
"I get that this irritates those of us who have been through breast cancer and what it does to our bodies. I do, though, welcome October and breast cancer awareness....if it makes just one person think about it and go get a mammogram, then it's worth it. I think people mean well, they just don't get it. Until you have been through the diagnosis, treatment, etc. you wouldn't get it. That doesn't mean people don't mean well....they are doing what they think is helpful, so that is not to be criticized...just become more informed!"
"What  !! No Bra Day ? I have no breasts because i had cancer what does no bra day have to do with that. I would love to not wear a bra with prosthetics , they are a pain !! It doesn't make anyone more aware as far as I'm concerned. Hey instead of hanging those stupid bras every where they should throw their old bras away and donate to help women that cant afford  breast cancer or donate to research ! I am a survivor today and I thank god for helping me with my toughest moments ."
"My mum has breast cancer and had a single mastectomy nearly 2 yrs ago. The journeys not over yet and all this no bra no makeup selfie rubbish makes my blood boil. They say it's to raise awareness but I find it insulting maybe that's because I'm angry that this has got my mum and I'm scared to death of losing her !"
"My surgery is Thursday. Double mastectomy!! Then Chemo. Possibly radiation ( God Bless each of you!! ) This is by far the most difficult journey ever!!!  ."
"I am a 2 year survivor and I honestly do not care what people try to do to promote breast cancer awareness.  Whether it's no bra day, pink things...it doesn't really matter, all that matters is that this propaganda makes women/men think about breast health. Let people wear zebra stripes and walk on their hands, I do not care as long as they do SBE and get mammograms regularly!!"
"Totally agree with you. Get a mammogram. Donate to research or to help pay for mammograms. I had a double mastectomy and reconstruction and also don't wear a bra and did chemo. Awareness and being proactive helps -- NOT gimmicks."
"I'm a breast cancer survivor but didn't go through a mastectomy. My friend did, though!  
I love seeing the NFL and other people wear pink and Run/Walk in charity events. I feel the no bra day or the show your strap day is ignorant and insensitive to women who have survived breast cancer, whether we have had a mastectomy or not!"
"I agree! I'm not wearing a bra right now, although I am fortunate in that my cancer could be addressed with a lumpectomy. After three surgeries, and five months of chemo, I am now having two months of radiation, and the skin where the radiation is aimed is too fragile to wear a bra. There is nothing cute about fighting breast cancer. Women walking around with no bra ""for the cause"" is not helpful, unless they donated to a reputable cancer research organization first."
"I've had breast cancer twice. I stopped counting after 10 surgeries. I've had so much chemo that they can barely find a useful vein to just draw blood to send it for lab work. I had to choose between radiation treatment and spending time with my dying father. I thank God for my survival and the support of others. I've struggled with survivor guilt when I witnessed peers, friends or colleagues much younger than me loose the fight. But  pink does not offend me. The games do not anger me. Braless women and men in pink in football uniforms certainly don't understand all I've been through but I have to appreciate that their efforts (though misguided and maybe a tad off the mark) are at least something that people are doing to show support when they don't know what else to do or say in these situations. I agree with Felicia Edmund Ferragamo... Lighten up. And yes if you have the $$$ of course donate or do something that does make a difference.  But try to understand that not everyone can give financially. What they are doing may not be perfect but they care enough to try and support us as we fight an illness that has affected millions of women AND men"
"I've had double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. 14 rounds of chemo and two more surgeries. I finished in September 2015. I have bras but some days they are uncomfortable with my implants so I take it off. Please don't insult people on no bra day. Some may be doing it to support all the women. But you are untitled to your opinion."
"Woman burned their bras back in the 60's, now woman are taking them off once again. Both stupid just like shaving ones head in solidarity for the woman going thru chemo. None of those make sense. All I can say to those of us who went through months of chemo, radition, surgeries,  LIGHTEN UP! Boobs, no boobs, bras, no bras, cancer sucks. Why let the actions of others dictate who you are or the way you feel. Just live your life!"
"Triple negative at age 31 diagnosed the week before Christmas.  Christmas is still hard it will be 7 yrs this 12/18.  6 months of chemo, 35 radiation treatments.  Many surgeries.  I love pink or anything with pink ribbons, or breast cancer related.  I feel the support in October when the athletes wear pink.  My daughter included.  Don't take everything so serious.  Remember you were given a second lease on life!"

"Please read this and consider what you post concerning various breast cancer ""awareness"" events. I am in agreement with her post"
"I agree totally.  I find it offensive to do something that is in poor taste in the name of some cause whether it's breast cancer or something else... I had a mastectomy and went through 16 rounds of chemo and show support by donating to research or organizations that help women and men battling this disease... Wear a pink ribbon but don't degrade something that the rest of us wish we still had if they hadn't tried to kill us"
"I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer last September, multiple surgeries, biopsies chemo and radiation. Reconstruction next summer. I really get mad when people do the walks and buy the cute pink socks etc... Because they don't do the research as to where the money goes. I donate to a local cancer organization that's twenty minutes away but in a different county. For years I contributed and walked. When I needed help financially to cover co pays I was told I wasn't a member of that county so o was ineligible. I started digging into the Susan G. Komen fundraiser and realized the cep has a huge salary. Please do your research as to where the money goes!"
"appreciated this article. I'm into my 4th month of chemo (yes, it is grueling), then surgery, then radiation. All the pink for October sure looks different to me from this vantage point than other years."
"I underwent a needle guided biopsy, infection complications, 4 Lumpectomies, 2 ports in and out, bilateral mastectomy, 2 breast reconstruction, ovaries removed, Chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and lymph edema of my left arm , which I call my Popeye arm because it gets so swollen!! But at the end of the day I'm alive, I'm strong and I AM A SURVIVOR!!!"
"I totally agree! No bra day is ridiculous. I had a mastectomy when I was 24 years old. I've spent the last 20 years dealing with symmetry; spent countless hours trying on hundreds of bras, bathing suits, shirts w/o stripes...trying to look as ""normal"" as possible. No bra day will never happen for me or thousands of women who have actually had breast cancer."
"I've had the no boobs day, one boob for months, can't wear bra's for years day. I'm a 2 time Surviver and sometimes people need to do crazy things to cope with this disease. ( A lot of things don't help like shaving your head when you don't have cancer, wearing pink, wearing no bra falls into this category) If you have been fighting for your life who cares what others do if it makes them feel better!"
"I agree with this. My Mom had breast cancer and a friend is going thru it now. The cutsie and sexualized stuff that has evolved is just nonesense and a bit usensitive. The culture we live in shows up everywhere."
"As a survivor, I understand that cancer is not a game. People have no idea!"
"I have no problem with #NoBraDay,  pink items for sale or any other way folks choose to be aware of breast cancer.  I have survived it!  I would prefer that everyone find a way to support research for a cure in a more direct manner so that funds are not lost to administrative costs, but what really matters is that women get mammograms for early detection.  What really matters is that we fight this horrible disease in all it's terrible variety.  What really matters is that we take care of each other and live to fight and love another day!"
"Double mastectomy,  tram-flap reconstruction,  7 year survivor."
"I am a one year survivor.  Frankly the only reason I would wear anything under my shirt anymore is to hide my misaligned nipples after the lumpectomy.  Otherwise after so many insults to my body with 8 rounds of chemo radiation and surgery I could care less about lingerie.   These women think they are making a statement in solidarity to me are rather misguided."
"I am on my second battle with breast cancer now.  Just finished up with my first reconstruction surgery and I love to see the pink stuff.  I love the games on facebook.  If it gets people talking and thinking about self exams and mammos then it worked.  I know that some charities don't give money like they are supposed to but if a life was saved from early detection because someone didn't wear a bra and remembered to check themselves than that is all that matters to me."
"Ok after some thought ""I spoke to soon"" just gets my temper up a bit I do realize its for awareness , I dont need awareness now.for that type of cancer but the awareness does keep my thoughts for others . Been there done that !! 11 years ago <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0094>~~<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0098>~~<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009D> !
If there hadn't been awareness to do a self breast exam I would not have found my cancer. I think infomation like that is important.Get away from selling pink stuff ""pink is my favorite color""and give information about how to check your self !! Information and Awareness is the key to the first step !<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009E>"
"I would have to agree with the part about taking care of someone locally.  What you donate by buying ""pink"" may or may not ever actually benefit someone.  Sitting with them, taking them to dinner or a movie and treating them like they are normal, dinner, cleaning their house , paying one of their bills, or just hanging out making plans for the future as they kick cancer in the teeth is a good way to support someone.  I never gave it much thought until I was diagnosed after sudden onset symptoms and had a double mastectomy, chemo and reconstruction.  I appreciate all my friends and family who just did every day things with me and took care of me when I needed help.  Including washing my hair before I could lift my arms to do it.  It's those every day things..."

"When you envy women who have breasts that aren't cold and scared and still have nipples, the no bra day is just another knife to the heart to what you no longer have, even when you are grateful to still have your life."
"Single mom of four kids and stage III invasive ductal carcinoma SURVIVOR!! I had to have lots of humor for the sake of my kids! This wasn't just my journey; it was all of ours! Happy to say I will be cancer free for 2 years next week! I'm about to graduate from nursing school; so, I can give back to other beautiful fighters as they go through their journey! I will truly be able to say, I know what you are going through and truly mean it!!"
"To all of you telling survivors to ""LIGHTEN UP"" stop attacking survivors for expressing their opinion. There is nothing about this article that says the author is angry. If survivors believe in a more beneficial form of education and raising money for research other than FB games that doesn't make them angry or holding on to anger. As a survivor you should support other survivors not tear them down. Judging and telling women they are holding on to anger or that they need to lighten up is rude. Not everyone holds your opinion and they shouldn't be judged for it. I don't see any you doing anything lbut tearing down women that are sharing their stories and trying to educate people on the other side of breast cancer. Shame on you."
"Well, I don't have cleavage. I have cleave. Not wearing a bra is not an option. Throws your upper back and neck out of alignment I use old bras for sleeping. wear one all the time. enjoy your freedom while you can."

"Combining aspirin and triptolide to prevent lung cancers

Binghui Shen, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Radiation Biology, in collaboration with his physician colleagues Reckamp and Dan Raz, M.D., co-director and surgical director of the Lung Cancer and Thoracic Oncology Program, is studying the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs in preventing lung cancer.

The researchers demonstrated that, when administered separately, aspirin and the drug triptolide (a derivative of a Chinese anti-inflammatory herb known as thunder god vine) each have the effect of moderately suppressing lung cancer development in mice. When combined, however, these two agents reduced the incidence of lung cancer in mice from 70 percent to only 5 percent.

Shen hypothesizes that the drug combination creates an anti-tumor microenvironment and directly kills lung cancer cells by blocking their key survival mechanisms. His new research seeks to increase understanding of how triptolide and aspirin might lower the risk of lung cancer recurrence and eliminate cancer."

"<U+259D> <U+2599><U+259D> <U+2599> STOP! STOP! STOP! You can't stop cancer with radiation, poison & hypothermia. STOP living in bumble bee land! Cancer is one of countless chronic metabolic diseases (noncommunicable) that have plagued humanity since the beginning. Scurvy, pernicious anemia, pellagra, night blindness are chronic metabolic diseases; all of which are well-known & well-documented vitamin deficits. The preventive, treatment & cure for cancer resides in leafy greens & seeds as these foods contain Amygdalin: a substance that's extraordinarily deadly to cancerous cells. Watch on You-Tube: ""World Without Cancer.""

A woman who's malnourished to the point of cancer is not a soldier. She is not automatically a candidate for sainthood. She is ignorant and ignorance exacts a toll. Surviving a train wreck isn't an act of bravery. Cancer is a measurable, easily explainable, regional, dietary disease. No one is afflicted with cancer as a turn of bad luck, for smoking cigarettes, or for having a cancer-stricken family. What makes regional? Diet. Diets are regional as they are traditional. The missing dietary factor is Amygdalin (vitamin B17).

Ahhh...the blatant hypocrisy and twisted psychology attached to cancer: Young sob-sisters will dutifully shave their heads in sympathetic acknowledgment of the harrowing, yet ""therapeutic,"" radiation-poisoning being suffered by a cancer-plagued friend. Yet, If I were to wear an eye-patch to show my support for a cataract-sufferer, pad my abdomen with pillows during my wife's pregnancy, or fake a limp because a brother recently lost a leg, I'd be deemed an aping fool.

Those who promote Gardasil, pre-emptive amputation of breasts & extirpation of axillary glands, mammography & the 4 accepted cancer ""treatments,"" promote quackery.

The untaxed Komen corporation provides: topflight executives on a mission to drive a world-class, insanely-profitable public relations campaign to propagate an international sorority of cancer-afflicted sob sisters suffering from a naturally-occurring (and thus: a naturally-cured) disease. This disease, known as cancer, is chronic (it persists in spite of the immune system), this disease is metabolic (noncommunicable). Cancer by its nature is a response to the healing process. Damaged tissue requires healing. When the healing process continues beyond its confines a tumorous mass forms to contain these dangerous, misplaced healing cells. Since healing cells are electrostatically negative & the immune system is electrostatically negative and since like-charges repel, the immune system cannot attack cancerous structures. The answer is Amygdalin (known as vitamin B17 or as Laetrile, when synthesized from apricot pips). Vitamin B17 only attacks cancer cells."

"It is a god send for so many, and yes, some of the many are children.

I am so tired of uniformed, self proclaimed ""do gooders"", trying to save us all, from ourselves!!!

Help build my project at the same time start your own:

In honor of my late wife Fannilia Celia Richardson, who lost her battle with breast cancer at the young age of 30. I am creating a ""Cancer Awareness Music Theater"" that will have a nationwide impact. An association and national contingency that will  give speeches and performances to highlight and elevate the fight against cancer for national <U+201C>Cancer Awareness<U+201D> For this generation and future generations to come, so that we can be fully prepared and also succeed, in this battle. There are 12 dominant cancers that  are taking us by storm and rapidly killing our wives, mothers, sisters, brothers and fathers, and friends because cancer does not discriminate whether it be age, creed, or race. My vision and Fannilia<U+2019>s Cancer Awareness Theater will make a difference in this world and save many lives.

Please feel free to donate to this amazing project that will do positive deeds and wonders through out the world where Cancer Awareness Is Concern.

P.S: In my 3 decade of my music career after loosing my wife to Breast Cancer on December 10th 2014 my interest is to produce my first music video which is also in honor of my wife Fannilia Celia Bell- Richardson beside the Cancer Awareness Theater I'm in process of raising funds for via We Share Crowd Funding which my composition is: Entitle <U+201C> The Curse Of Cancer <U+201C> which soothe the heart to does that lost someone to cancer.

"<U+259D> <U+2599><U+259D> <U+2599> STOP! STOP! STOP! You can't stop cancer with radiation, poison & hypothermia. STOP living in bumble bee land! Cancer is one of countless chronic metabolic diseases (noncommunicable) that have plagued humanity since the beginning. Scurvy, pernicious anemia, pellagra, night blindness are chronic metabolic diseases; all of which are well-known & well-documented vitamin deficits. The preventive, treatment & cure for cancer resides in leafy greens & seeds as these foods contain Amygdalin: a substance that's extraordinarily deadly to cancerous cells. Watch on You-Tube: ""World Without Cancer.""

A woman who's malnourished to the point of cancer is not a soldier. She is not automatically a candidate for sainthood. She is ignorant and ignorance exacts a toll. Surviving a train wreck isn't an act of bravery. Cancer is a measurable, easily explainable, regional, dietary disease. No one is afflicted with cancer as a turn of bad luck, for smoking cigarettes, or for having a cancer-stricken family. What makes regional? Diet. Diets are regional as they are traditional. The missing dietary factor is Amygdalin (vitamin B17).

Ahhh...the blatant hypocrisy and twisted psychology attached to cancer: Young sob-sisters will dutifully shave their heads in sympathetic acknowledgment of the harrowing, yet ""therapeutic,"" radiation-poisoning being suffered by a cancer-plagued friend. Yet, If I were to wear an eye-patch to show my support for a cataract-sufferer, pad my abdomen with pillows during my wife's pregnancy, or fake a limp because a brother recently lost a leg, I'd be deemed an aping fool.

Those who promote Gardasil, pre-emptive amputation of breasts & extirpation of axillary glands, mammography & the 4 accepted cancer ""treatments,"" promote quackery.

The untaxed Komen corporation provides: topflight executives on a mission to drive a world-class, insanely-profitable public relations campaign to propagate an international sorority of cancer-afflicted sob sisters suffering from a naturally-occurring (and thus: a naturally-cured) disease. This disease, known as cancer, is chronic (it persists in spite of the immune system), this disease is metabolic (noncommunicable). Cancer by its nature is a response to the healing process. Damaged tissue requires healing. When the healing process continues beyond its confines a tumorous mass forms to contain these dangerous, misplaced healing cells. Since healing cells are electrostatically negative & the immune system is electrostatically negative and since like-charges repel, the immune system cannot attack cancerous structures. The answer is Amygdalin (known as vitamin B17 or as Laetrile, when synthesized from apricot pips). Vitamin B17 only attacks cancer cells."

"I DONATED MY GENOMES TO SCIENCE!

Now we can ALL do more in the fight against breast cancer. There is a new DNA databank created by the geneticists from Columbia University and the New York Genome Center called DNA.Land. DNA.Land is in partnership with the National Breast Cancer Coalition to better understand the genetic risks of breast cancer.

You can contribute to their research if you have access to your genomes. You have access to your genomes if you have ever tested with one of the top three genetic testing companies 23andMe, FamilyTreeDNA or AncestryDNA. If you have already tested then you can start sharing right now, it's FREE! If you haven't tested then please consider doing so. You get to learn what you're made of and get an opportunity to advance cancer research. It's a win win! https://dna.land/"

Antitumor activity of plant cannabinoids with emphasis on the effect of cannabidiol on human breast carcinoma. (2006)
""Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exhibits antitumor effects on various cancer cell types, but its use in chemotherapy is limited by its psychotropic activity. We investigated the antitumor activities of other plant cannabinoids, i.e., cannabidiol, cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabidiol acid and THC acid, and assessed whether there is any advantage in using Cannabis extracts (enriched in either cannabidiol or THC) over pure cannabinoids. Results obtained in a panel of tumor cell lines clearly indicate that, of the five natural compounds tested, cannabidiol is the most potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth (IC(50) between 6.0 and 10.6 microM), with significantly lower potency in noncancer cells.""

"I don't get mammograms because of the radiation, which some believe can actually make you more prone to breast cancer.  There is a technology called thermography which only uses heat and no radiation and may actually be a better tool for diagnosing breast cancer and other health problems.  Because it is not considered the current standard of care, the Insurance companies don't cover the cost. I wish there was more flexibility with insurance policies and more research spent on alternative methods of prevention.  I have had thermography scans done at my chiropractors office. It seems that only the more natural minded doctors offer them."

We went without,for the 8 years of this horrible disease.My suggestion,give a gas,food,gift card.Directly to a family or family member.Go to the hospital near you or give it to your Dr.to give to a cancer patient! All these cancer walks talks,items sold are nice.But,it COSTS the survivor to participate! i had 7 surgeries in one year.Yes,I had insurance.But,I pay the premium every Month! Cancer is expensive.EARLY DETECTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN do! Thank you all for caring.( My hospital and Dr's.we're kind enough to accept payments,each month,I have my word)"

Help build my project at the same time start your own:

In honor of my late wife Fannilia Celia Richardson, who lost her battle with breast cancer at the young age of 30. I am creating a ""Cancer Awareness Music Theater"" that will have a nationwide impact. An association and national contingency that will  give speeches and performances to highlight and elevate the fight against cancer for national <U+201C>Cancer Awareness<U+201D> For this generation and future generations to come, so that we can be fully prepared and also succeed, in this battle. There are 12 dominant cancers that  are taking us by storm and rapidly killing our wives, mothers, sisters, brothers and fathers, and friends because cancer does not discriminate whether it be age, creed, or race. My vision and Fannilia<U+2019>s Cancer Awareness Theater will make a difference in this world and save many lives.

Please feel free to donate to this amazing project that will do positive deeds and wonders through out the world where Cancer Awareness Is Concern.

P.S: In my 3 decade of my music career after loosing my wife to Breast Cancer on December 10th 2014 my interest is to produce my first music video which is also in honor of my wife Fannilia Celia Bell- Richardson beside the Cancer Awareness Theater I'm in process of raising funds for via We Share Crowd Funding which my composition is: Entitle <U+201C> The Curse Of Cancer <U+201C> which soothe the heart to does that lost someone to cancer.

Please feel free to contribute to this amazing project that is a need for the fight against this deadly epidemic."

<U+201C>Therapeutic<U+201D> radiation, in any amount, harms living tissue. (Roentgen rays, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, x-radiation, ionizing radiation, corpuscular radiation can be implemented for diagnostic purposes, but never for therapeutic benefit.) Chemo- <U+201C>therapy<U+201D> poisons healthy tissue [necrocytotoxin <U+2013> a toxin that produces death of cells]. Of the 4 protocols in traditional (allopathic) cancer <U+201C>therapy<U+201D>: surgery (cutting), radiation (burning), cryo-ablation/cryosurgery (hypothermia) & chemo/chemical (poisoning/toxifying), only manual surgery possesses some legitimacy when malignant (cancerous) growth has reached a certain stage. It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, pokeberries, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress. A person whose<U+FEFF> diet is deficient in these nitrilosidic foods (those foods rich in Amygdalin, the substance of which the molecularity is 1 part: the natural analgesic<U+FEFF> benzaldehyde, 1 part: hydrogen cyanide, 2 parts: glucose) is incapable of stopping the over-production<U+FEFF> of healing cells<U+FEFF> thus this person has cancer. To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya. Supplement your diet with the nutrients (of which 95% of Americans are chronically deficient) that compliment Laetrile (vitamin B17):  <U+2460> zinc (which is the transport mechanism for Laetrile/vitamin B17) <U+2461> vitamin C (build up to 6 grams a day) <U+2462><U+FEFF> manganese <U+2463> magnesium <U+2464> selenium <U+2465> vitamins B6, B9 & B12 <U+2466> vitamin A <U+2467> vitamin E (at least 2,000 I.U.) 

A cheap, over-the-counter, urine-analysis pregnancy test is accurate in 92% of cases at detecting cancerous cell activity in the body. Men & women can test for cancer upon rising with a pregnancy test as cancer and pre-embryonic cells are virtually indistinguishable (in functionality) from cells designated as: adenocarcinomal, adenocarcinomic, ameboid, anaplastic, angiogenetic, angiogenic, astrocytomal, atypical, basal, blastocystic, cacoethic, cancerial, cancerian, cancerigenic, cancerigenical, cancerogenic, cancerogenical, cancroidal, cankerous, carcinoembryonic, carcinogenic, carcinogenical, carcinoidal, carcinomal, carcinomatoid, carcinomatous, carcinomic, carcinosarcomal, cholangiocarcinomal, dedifferentiated, dysplastic, embryonal, embryonic, embryonical, endometrial, endophytic, epithelial, epitheliomatous, endophytic, exophytic, extra-embryonic, fibroblastic, gestational, glioblastomal, H<U+00FC>rthle, hypermutable, hypermutagenic, leucaemicus, leukaemic, leukaemical, leukemic, leukemical, leukocythemic, leukocytomic, liposarcomal, lymphomal, lymphomic, macroglobulinemiac, malignant, malignantal, malignantic, malignus, melanocytic, melanomatous, melanotic, metastatic, metastatical, M<U+00FC>llerian, mutagenic, mutagenical, mutated, mutational, mycoplasmal, mycoplasmic, myelodysplastic, myelodysplastical, myelomal, myelomatoid, myelomonocytic, myelomonocytical, myeloproliferative, myxoid, myxoidic, necrogenic, necrogenous, neo-blastic, neo-embryonic, neo-fetal, neo-formative, neo-genetic, neo-genetical, neo-plasiac, neo-plasmic, neo-plastic, neo-plastigenic, odontogenic, oncogenic, oncologic, oncological, osteosarcomal, paraneoplastic, paraneoplastical, paraneoplastical, pathogenetic, pathogenetical, pathogenic, pathogenical, placental, placentational, pleiomorphic, pleomorphic, polymorphic, polymorphical, pluripotent, pre-cancerous, pre-embryonal, pre-leukemic, promyelocytic, promyelocytical, proto-embryonic, proto-leukemic, pre-squamous, proto-oncogenetic (gene), proto-tumorous, quasi-neoplastic, sarcomal, sarcomatous, squamous, toxicogenic, toxicogenomic, trophic, trophical, trophoblastic, trophoblastical, trophoplasmatic, trophoplasmic, tumefactive, tumefied, tumid, tumoral, tumorigenic, tumorlike, tumorous. Watch (available on You-Tube) G. Edward Griffin's ""World Without Cancer.""

IN BRIEF Concerning Cancer: 1. Take a pregnancy test just after waking up. For men a positive result means either cancer or a false positive. Take another test the next day. If a man gets 3 positive results then likely he has cancer somewhere. For women a positive result means (if she's able to become pregnant) she's pregnant or she has cancer, or she's pregnant and she has cancer, or a false positive (the test result is wrong). 

2. Several positive pregnancy test results = cancer. What next? STOP eating red meat, sugar, corn syrup. STOP drinking booze. STOP (or at least cut back on) smoking.

3. Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. Take vitamin B17 (at least 1 gram daily) and wheat grass and/or barley grass liquid or capsules (they're rich in vitamin B17), on a full stomach daily (you can't overdose on them ~ they're not poisonous). Take a zinc supplement. Take pancreatic enzymes.  

Since 2009 I have ordered vitamin B17 from Metabolic Products in California. 500 m.g. costs 87 cents. My mother is 80. She's been taking a gram per day for a year. Her pregnancy tests were positive in June 2013. They're negative now. I told her that she could cut her daily dose of vitamin B17 from 1,000 m.g. to 100 m.g. now that she's cancer-free but she insists on taking the high dose as it's made her fingernails harder and her hair thicker.

REVIEW: TAKE pregnancy tests to detect cancer. TAKE vitamin B17 (and as many of the listed vitamins as you can, especially zinc). Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. STOP eating red meat & cane sugar. It will take several weeks on B17 therapy to turn out negative pregnancy test results. The tumor WILL NOT shrink much even after the cancer is gone because only 10% of the tumor was cancer. The tumor MAY swell temporarily as the vitamin B17 kills malignant cells.

NOTE: Vitamin B17 therapy WILL NOT destroy the tumor! Vitamin B17 therapy will destroy the malignant cells (cancerous cells) of the tumor and within the tumor. Only 5% to 10% of the cells comprising a tumor are cancerous cells. In time the tumorous growth will be absorbed, in whole or in part. Unless the tumor is cosmetically displeasing, impinging nerves or blood vessels or hampering normal bodily function then let it be. 

The life expectancy for American medical doctors is 58 years.
The life expectancy for Haitian voodoo witch doctors is 62.7 years."

Happy thoughts & pleasantries are meaningless in regards to killing cancer cells. 

Divide and conquer is a precept of war. There are now hundreds of ""cancers."" Treatment strategies are customized & personalized. The cancer industry has created an ""army"" of clinicians, physicians & laboratorians to win ""battles"" against cancer. The cancer industry mounts ""campaigns."" Nixon declared ""war"" on cancer. Cancer-diseased women are ""drafted"" into breast cancer ""boot-camps."" Patients ""fight"" cancer heroically & bravely. The cancer industry has an ""arsenal"" of treatment options. Next year a new ""weapon"" against cancer will be unveiled. Several years ago the cancerocidal ""gamma knife"" was used on Patrick Swayze to ""fortify"" his ""battle stratagem."" Doctors, researchers & nurses of cancrology are ""foot soldiers on the march"" sworn to the selfless task of preventing, treating and curing a morass of dreadful cancerigenic diseases that plague modern man. Is no one safe? 

We pray for knowledge & guidance rather than a divine suspension of physical law. The Creator provides in His bounty the cures for diseases.

"The new mammogram guidelines is ridiculous. Due to the high cancer rate in my family I get one every year. No one is going to tell me when to get exams for anything. If you wait until you are 45 years old, it may be too late. Women should get a yearly mammogram & gyn exam as a preventative measure. Shame on the American Cancer Society and the insurance companies!"
"And remember not ALL Breast Cancer is found during a Mammogram.
Please learn about Inflammatory Breast Cancer ~
http://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/ibc-fact-sheet"
"So agree with her....I am a nurse and have cared for young women with breast cancer....as women , we are now told when we can and can't have our pap tests, now when to have mammograms, drs. don't have to do breast exams with yearly check-ups.....SAD!, We are on our own....."
"I was diagnosed at 26! Because my husband found a lump. And I had to kick and scream to get a mammogram.  With no family history. It has been 9 years and I have been cancer free. Im still undergoing reconstruction to this day."
"This recommendation by the ASC is disastrous! It's a giant step backward in women's breast health and cancer diagnosis. As a breast cancer survivor, thank you Ms Robach for your advocacy about this extremely important issue."
"I had been getting mammograms since I was in my early thirties, when they discovered a spot on my right breast.  The place could not be felt and was a fast growing cancer   Had I waited, my life would have been drastically changed  As it was I had to endure a total mastectomy and I have now been cancer free for 20 years. The idea that mammograms can be put off if ludicrous. No one in my family ever had breast cancer   It has to start with someone and I pray that it is NOT YOU!!!!!"
"Get your Mammogram !!!!"
"It should also be noted that women over 80 are being told they don't need mammograms.  My mother died at 88 of cancer that started in her breast.  NO 80 year old breast cancer surviver should die of breast cancer just because someone thinks they no longer need a mammogram in their 80's."
"My mother was diagnosed with advanced Breast Cancer in her 40's and passed away at the age of 50. I do not agree with changing the age for mammograms.   The earlier a cancer is found  the better chance you have of surviving"
"I totally agree! Having been diagnosed at age 43 with stage 2 BC, we found it was also in the lymph nodes. Had I waited longer it would have been far more advanced and more difficult chemo regimen. These new guidelines are ridiculous."
"Agreed!!  Breast cancer victim at 46.  14 year survivor!<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0083>"
"Considering I had a clear mammogram in April, the day after my diagnostic mammogram there was a huge lump which is now my cancer. I think they are figuring out how harmful mammograms are."
"The new recommendations are ridiculous.  I started my mammograms at age 35 because if family history and had one every year except for 2 years when I was pregnant and breastfeeding.  Because I knew my body so well U felt the huge lump agile breastfeeding and immediately insisted on a mammogram and thankfully my breast surgeon did a biopsy and at the age of 38 I was diagnosed with stage 3a Breast cancer DCIS ironically in my dycts. My daughter saved my life and me knowing my body so well. Ladies keep fighting or get your mammograms ans biopsies as early as age 30."
"Totally agree! The MEN making these decisions need not get their prostates checked until 60 then????
I'm 47. I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer 10 months ago. On a routine mammogram, that I've had since I was 35, bc of family history.
ROUTINE MAMMOGRAM SINCE I WAS 35. Thank God for my Doctors!"
"Please get your mammogram!!"

"Mine was found at age 40 on my 1st mammogram.  The oncologist told me it saved my life.  I am angry and sad."
"Totally agree! I was diagnosed at 44 w/ VERY aggressive triple negative breast cancer! No family history- if I had waited I would be dead....bottom line! Women will die because of this recommendation!!"
"I was 27 when my mammogram found my cancer. That's when I lost my breast and started my journey.  I'm now 57. Breast cancer doesn't even run in my family."
"I think it is bullshit they changed the age. My niece had just turned 30 and had I believe stage 3 or 4 breast cancer. There is no history of it in our family. I have read about a lot of young women with breast cancer. So now they want to say get them later. I would like to know what kind of drugs these people are on. A pure dumbass move."
"I had breast cancer in 2009 and I agree with you 100 percent"
"I work at a large cancer center and work for breast oncologist. She also disagrees with the recommendations. And as much as she disagrees with a later start, she's even more concerned about the 2 years between rather than one. Time is always the enemy with a cancer diagnosis."
"Wrong in so many ways - delayed mammograms, then the older population ASC identifies as more likely to get cancer are told not to get a mammogram every year, then doctors are told there is no need to to manual breast exams??? What happened to early detection saving lives? My daughter would  be dead if her doctor had follow these ""guidelines."""
"These guidelines generalize women as statistics! This is an individual disease!! Women and their doctors should be first with healthcare! Not the other way around!!"

"I totally agree....my doctor told me I didn't need a mammogram when I was 49 because I had no history and was still in my 40's however at 50 I was diagnosed with lobular and ductal cancer early stage and had to have a bilateral and to this day I am bitter because just maybe....if I had it at 49 it would have been caught then...who knows but I still to this day remind the Dr of his guide lines that they are not the best for everyone...I should have insisted since in my early 40's I was diagnosed with colon cancer and had to fight with my primary dr to get a ""referral"" after a test showed blood in my stool  PLEASE no matter what age you are stand up for yourself no one knows your body like you and how you are feeling!!"
"I too was diagnosed this year with no family history. Mammogram caught it early."
"Angry is what all women should be. I wouldn't  be here today if I listen to this .  I was 43 when I had my mastectomy"
"Amen, Amy Robach!!!!"
"I had a clear mammogram a year ago in September. Five months later I found a lump in a self-exam. It was stage 2 non-invasive. I have gone through chemo and radiation and found that I am positive for the BRCA2 gene and am going in for surgery tomorrow to have my ovaries removed. I'm 61 and have had mammograms since I was 40. They are extremely important but so is self-exams. Always be aggressive with your own health."
"I was 35 when I found my lump and 36 when I had my first mammogram. Grade 3 stage 2a invasive ductal carcinoma and DCIS. I think every woman should have a mammogram at 35."
"Early detection with a 3D mammogram saved me.  Many women will die due to these new recommendations.  We are not statistics!"
"I love and respect you so much, @AmyRobach! I just recently asked my doctor for a mammogram and colonoscopy and he flat out said, ""No, you are too young!"" I am 37- years old, and both my grandmothers are survivors of colon cancer and lymphoma. Sadly, I lost my hero and my world...my dad, two years ago to stage 4 esophageal cancer. I have cancer on both sides of my family, having lost four uncles and my father to cancer, and doctor denied my wish for these tests. Now, I will seek a new family physician and battle the insurance because they do not want to pay for these tests unless there is cause....and I'm not of recommended age. Ridiculous! I will not give up until I am treated, and know everything will be alright! Keep on fighting and you're always in my prayers. May God bless you, always."
"I had my first mammogram at 40 within 2 weeks I was having ultrasound, biopsy and surgery. Thank God mine was calcium deposits but left undiagnosed it could have been much worse."
"I think it should depend on Family history or if you find a lump at whatever age...If there's no problem, then you should wait until you're 40...I started when I was 45...Eight years ago a very small lump was discovered...It was  removed and benign...After that, I've had a mammogram/ultra sound every year...Just went for one Tuesday and got results Wednesday...All is clear...I won't mind every other year...But high risk should every year...."
"Please get a mammogram as early as you can.  If I didnt go yearly my stage 0 would never have been found.  And for those who say stage 0 is precancerous or noninvasive I say thank god I had bilateral matestomies.  My pathology in one breast was positive in 8/11 of the slides.  If I waited another 6mo or a year I might be at stage 1-2.  I am also fighting to be my own advocate as I had a positive margin after mastectomy:  my doctor just took more tissue samples near my positive margin at the tome of my second stage reconstruction.  So im waitingnow for the results.  I also had no family history.  I had a baseline mammo at age 35 years ago."
"I was diagnosed at 27 four years ago. Insurance did not fight me or my doctor. I had a mammogram, ultra sound and biopsy all in the same day. I'm lucky and blessed and I understand my experience was quite rare. I can't understand for the life of me why that right is being taken away from people. It's not fair. They say early detection is key, yet early detection methods are being taken away from us? I'm disgusted and heartbroken over these regulations."
"Getting worse all the time! I mean dose the US really want to find a cure for cancer? Lots of money involved here!"
"Totally agree with her--new guidelines are ridiculous!"
"I was diagnosed at 42  it had spread to my lymph nodes. I may not be here today with these new guides."
"I am so angry with this. I would very likely be dead. By the time I was 42 I had been diagnosed x2 once in each boob with different markers and types. This is going the wrong way. What big pharma got involved?"
"BRAVO!!!!"
"No!!!!!!  The guidelines should NOT have changed!  UNREAL!  
Ladies follow the old guidelines!"
"The new guidelines could have left me dead."
"I was diagnosed at age 35, 39 and 44. I would not be around if I listened to the 40 recommendation. FYI I have no history."
"I was diagnosed at Age 42 on one side and age 43 on the other early stage. If I went by these guide lines, where would I be now."
"It's maddening!!!! I was diagnosed at 39! With absolutely no family history. Just completed my treatments and surgeries and don't know what kind of outcome I would have had if I had waited."
"Well said..."
"Instead of prevention, it sounds like the healthcare system wants to make more and more money. This is going backwards! If I had waited until I was 50 to have a mammogram I would not be here today!"
"I'm with her! I've had breast problems since I was 17yrs old, I'm now 51, I'd love to know who makes these ""guidelines?"" Ladies I recommend DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THEM!!! Do whatever it takes to stay heathy, pay attention to your own body & intuition!! EARLY DETECTION IS KEY! Screw these guidelines!! Stay aware of yourself!!! Can't stress enough!

"Agreed! My first mammo showed bc. I had a successful treatment and outcome. Waiting till 45, it would have been much worse."
"You are absolutely right!!!!!!"
"I agree. I was first diagnosed at the age of 29 and again at 30 with no family history."
"It's garbage.  Women aren't statistics.  I'll continue with yearly and personal breast exams and mammograms.  I've been doing this since I was 30.  At 56, I'm not changing my routine.  Too many suffer and too many lives lost."
"I was stage 2 at age 42. No history. I'm outraged that they would change this!!!!"
"It's crazy!  I would not be here today if I had waited till I was 40 much less any later!"
"I agree with Amy and her concern about Insurance Companies not paying for the testing for those that want it earlier than the determined recommendation."
"I had one in February and in july i found the lump that is how fast cancer comes the number 1 thing to do is check your self but i agree everyone should have it every year"
"i dont want crackpots telling me or anyone how to care for themselves! check yourself monthly get your ob/gyn to do regular exams and get mammograms yrly"

"Tell em Amy! Asinine info ACS!!!"
"This guideline is ridiculous!  Thank God I got my baseline at 35!"
"The more I think about this the angrier I get. This is not about anxiety of false positives it is about insurance company's not wanting to pay for the extra testing associated with the false positives, all about money not about lives!"
"The lives saved out weigh the ""anxiety"" felt by the false positives.  I was diagnosed at 41 and very aggressive so if I would have waited to 45....I wouldn't be here to have the mammo"

"Heavy metals and breast cancer:
The prominence of estrogens in the etiology of breast cancer has lead to the suggestion that exposure to environmental estrogens may increase the risk of developing the disease. Metall Oestrogens are small ionic metals and metalloids that include metal/metalloid anions and divalent cations, such as cadmium, calcium, cobalt, copper, nickel, chromium, lead, mercury, and tin. Because metallic estrogens activate the estrogen receptor in the absence of estradiol, exposure to these metals may increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
we hope to join us, we interested in updated informations about cancer.

"I am having both of mine removed in December.......BRCA 1 positive, stage 1 breast cancer, age 37."
"I had stage 3B in left breast and opted for radical bi lateral mastectomies . Just didn't have the stamina to worry about the ca free breast and the possibility of having to face treatment of breast ca once again ( 8 months of chemo, 32 radiation treatments  and another surgery ) Peace of mind was worth loosing both breasts and I would do it again without hesitation ..."
"I'm reading this exactly a year since my diagnosis - I was encouraged to have a double mastectomy 2 weeks after finding out I had breast cancer - I was in shock and having to decide - I understood I had to have the breast removed that had cancer but why the other one if nothing was wrong with it - it was the hardest decision of my life and I dwelled on it seeking onions and craved to speak to other ladies who had been in the same position - I actually ended up going with s different surgeon (for other reasons) and she said to just deal with the one at the moment as it is twice the operation, twice the risk of infection and that I could always have the other breast off later like at reconstruction time ... I deliberated and chose to do the double but I backed out of that decision the day before the operation / I just couldn't bear not having a breast or nipple so I just had the one breast removed.  A year later I feel comfortable with my decision - had a mammogram and ultrasound yesterday - all seems good with my remaining breast (thus far).  Still eats my mind and waiting to know when I can have reconstruction as then I will also have to decide all over again whether to keep the good breast still."
"Had a bilateral mastectomy and never looked back. Best thing I ever did."
"Having a bilateral mastectomy doesn't necessarily mean that you are free of reoccurrence....I learnt that the hard way! 14mths post bilateral and chemo I have BC mets in the liver....."
"I too, opted for the bilateral mastectomy.  God Bless You...you are here!!!"
"I opted for a double mastectomy- even after the surgeon offered to attempt a lumpectomy.  I am soooo glad to have made that decision.  I don't miss my heavy breasts - and I certainly don't miss the concern and worry of a recurrence!!"
"I made the decision at 31 to have a bilateral mastectomy done. The best decision I made concerning my health, all why being a single mom to two handsome young boys. I have never looked back. I took the 5 year Lupron shot  and am now one year out and doing well. God bless any one going through cancer and best wishes"
"It scares me so much to hear how many women under the recommended age for starting mammograms have breast cancer.  I'll be 30 in April, I do a self-exam every 6 weeks, have my annual gynocogical exam every year, but I still feel like I should do more.  I wish I could start mammograms this year, but I know it would be prohibitively expensive.

To all of you who are fighting or are survivors, my heart goes out to you.  You are so brave, and so beautiful!"
"I had a bilateral mastectomy in June. I am a stage 2b also.  I'm glad I did.  Still have reconstruction ahead of me. I found that having both of them removed didn't bother me as much as I anticipated  it would."
"I was lucky just a lumpectomy in 2012, but I'm stressing out while awaiting results of a biopsy of the skull bone my appointment is on Monday waiting to exhale."
"I asked whether to have my other healthy breast removed and was advised not to. Post-op, i found it difficult to find reasonably priced, beautiful pocketed bras and swimwear, so decided to start selling them myself. If you are in the same position, or know somebody who is, check out my website - www.taraswimwear.co.nz. Having gorgeous underwear has helped me accept my situation and I love being able to help other women. Kia kaha - stay strong"
"I too have one breast now and every day wish I had taken them both...everyday as I dress I feel like such a freak the fake boob is hot it's heavy and sometimes rubs me the wrong way lol my kids say that I should be happy I am alive, and I am but if I had to make the decision again both would be gone!!! Stay strong everyone xo"
"People we should fight against cancer"
"Another women under the Am Cancer Society's new guidelines - 31 well under the 45 yrs old they recommended."
"Each to their own but for peace of mind ,both were my option too. Wanted the rest of my life with the people i love not returning to fight again . All the luck in the world to those going through it today x"
"OMG! Reading your story was like looking at my own life.  From the feelings of having one breast to the time frame it took me to remove the healthy one! My thoughts and feelings are exactly the same as yours!"
"I totally agree! !! Wish I would have done that to."

"At least Facebook reinstated the photo. It should have never been reported in the first place, however. If someone can show their butt hanging out of their pants/bikini/etc and boobs busting out of their top (if they even have one on that is) then breastfeeding women have a right to post the magical moments of feeding their nursling."
"I wouldn't mind at all. It's a beautiful photo. I'm so pleased that Emma was able to breast feed her baby."
"She's not all dress up provocatively ,she's just doing a normal feeding of her baby. I have nothing against this photo! It's the people who want to send shocking provoking photos out of breastfeeding dressed and made up like they are not naturally everyday. I call them the bombshell breast feeders! Let's keep breastfeeding a natural thing it's not for Letterio de Lucast or shock value it's life!"
"I can see how people might be upset because you can see the areola and tiny bit of the nipple so close up, but as a mother of a premie who couldn't breastfeed right away either, I think it's adorable and it shows just how tiny this precious baby really is."
"A beautiful picture, makes me realise how much I miss breastfeeding."
"I wouldn't mind at all the mum and baby are beautiful"
"How ever..about this picture,   She is as Mom (Mother ) take a lot of time to bereadtfeeding her child, 
I appreciate her for the struggle had a pregnant,  
gave breast feeding, 
take a bath the baby, 
teaching the baby, 
and grow up, 
I can't imagine how strong she is..."
"This photo does not bother me. I seen worst photos on FB that does not involve breastfeeding, those are the ones people should get all hot & bothered about!"
"Would not bother me,  it's a natural way to feed your baby."
"I have seen penises, side breasts, and much more provacative photos than a woman feeding her baby."
"Breast feeding is a normal beautiful process between mother and child and creates a wonderful bond.  I can't see why people get upset about it.  There are far worse images and other crap to complain about on the tinterweb and in life.  Folk should get a grip."
"Lovely photo of you and your beautiful baby."
"100% no I say 60% of the USA was feed this way so if anyone have a problem with this and any women/mother feeding there baby shouldn't have children i e child use the microwave"
"I don't mind at all. Breastfed my three children for a year."
"breast feeding is a natural, wholesome wonderful experience and it should be celebrated!"
"Breast feeding is natural and beautiful."
"I mean they're her photo's, they don't really matter to the public, I'm not sure why you would even have a photo of your child open to the public on your profile. People generally report photos for their own satisfaction anyway, it doesn't really offend them."
"Yes.. Why do I want to see a woman breast feeding her child on my newsfeed?? There is no reason what so ever to post it for the world to see!!"
"Breastfeeding is.natural. it would.not bother me."
"Why r people so bothered by this pic. This is normal for breastfeeding."
"I don't mind , I breastfed my 3 children."
"For the love of God there are more important things to worry about in this day and age than a mother feeding her precious baby in the most natural way possible.  Why does everyone have to be so sensitive and easily offended??  Get over it people and get a damn life so maybe you will stop worrying about everyone else's. ..geeez!!!"
"Nudity is nudity. Whether it's a glimpse of nipple and/or areola during breastfeeding or exposure of nipple and/or areola on a woman in a sexualized manner. Neither should be on Facebook."
"I've seen lots of offensive things on Facebook, and this is NOT one of them! Prayers for this Mother and her Baby!"
"This is why God invented women's breasts!"
"No problem at all. Funny how ""this"" offends but Kardashians showing every nook and cranny is OK???  How."
"what a precious moment in time.  What a shame people can't what human babies eat without getting their knickers in a twist."
"Come on, This! Is! Life! and the best she could do for her premature baby.        I wish you a happy and healthy life."
"Why does anyone mind seeing a naked breast? It's exactly the same as a naked arm or leg. IT'S SKIN!! Get over the ""taboo"" of a naked breast. Let a mom be a mom anywhere she wants to."
"I have no problem with this or the actual photo. This is a mother doing what God intended!"
"There is a difference, she is properly clothed not but naked taking a selfie."
"Its a beautiful sight.  More power to her."
"I'd rather see precious moments like this 100x a day rather then 1/2 the stuff I do see! Where's the outrage and disgust over all the fighting videos and sexually explicit crap! If I don't like what a fb friend is posting I either ""unfriend"" them or unfollow their post! Plan & simple."
"Omg honestly people do what you want with your kids this shit is getting annoying have respect for one another and I don't think its so much people dont wanna see it. They just dont think girls should whip there boobs out in a public place do you every think maybe other parents just don't want there child seeing a woman breast.Than when this shit happens it goes on about but its okay for other woman just grow the f up as a woman im tired of hearing about this crap.Im sure people are also getting tired of being called perverts when it as nothing to do about that its just called respect and breast feeding is normal but when you take your bare breast out in front of a bunch of people its different people are going to have different things to say its called life."
"So beautiful and oh so important!"
"Wouldn't mind at all"
"This is the most natural way of feeding babies!! Nothing wrong with this at all unless your a weird pervert<U+2026>......"
"No, wouldn't bother me"
"Nope I don't mind"
"Some people just need to get a life."
"Not at all"
"There us nothing wrong with this , as it is a natural an beautiful to see , well done sweetie and in happy for you and your family to have this lovely bundle of joy in your lives"
"No, it is sweet<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0080>. I get why this would be an exciting event, worthy of a fb post.  Likewise, there are posts of newborns being embraced by their moms wearing hospital robes that reveal just as much."
"Doesn't bother me at all, actually it shows me that how ignorant other people are,  Glad their baby has made this milestone,  God Bless, and to all the haters, ,quit hating!!!!"

"Nope"

"Nooooooooo"
"I remember every single one of them <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00B1>. What were we thinking?"
"I mostly agree with this except I didn't like when people said, ""oh, you look great."" First, I knew I didn't look great, and second, it made me want to scream, ""I don't care what I look like,  I FEEL horrible, and I need you to acknowledge that!"" I guess everyone is just different in how they cope."
"My mother is currently fighting stage 4 breast cancer and I've learned that all she really wants is to have someone by her side. No matter if you're just laying there, the fact that she has someone to talk to and feel like she has a purpose makes her strong. All cancer patients want is physical and emotional support. That doesn't mean you tell them constantly it's gonna be okay, or tell them how great they look, they don't care about that. They just need to know you're there for them."
"""It's going to be okay"" is received as ""Yeah, sure; it's gonna be okay for YOU."""
"Yep... I cringed when someone would say "" it's gonna be okay""..."
"So true!!!!"
"I am the opposite, when someone would say it's going to be ok...this gave me more positivity to keep on going and helped me stay positive.  Sure my daughter, son  and husband were not physically experiencing what I was going through, but emotionally they were there every step of the way, tell me ""it's going to be ok you got this, we got this.""   Total strangers would give me that encouragement almost daily and I am so thankful for them.  I only wish I could have the guts to throw those encouraging words to survivors as they go through the struggle of and for their life.  I found myself getting angry with other survivors as they were going or had gone through, telling me ""well I never had that happen you need to relax"" or ""my oncologists told me to take this or do this I would change oncologists, you should go to mine""."

"While I understand what this mom was attempting to say, it does come across as aggressive.  First of all, the ""yelling capitals"" should go... it automatically makes the reader assume a defensive mental stance.  Also, if she had phrased her concern in a less ""you other parents are bad, you're doing Halloween wrong, stop it now"" way, it probably would be better received.  Something along these lines would sit better with me:  ""Halloween is one of the most fun and exciting holidays for children, but it can also be a time where some children feel left out.  For children with food allergies and other medical limitations, it can be very disheartening to not have treats that they can enjoy.  To make it possible for all of our children to be in on the fun, please consider either offering treats that don't contain common allergens (nuts, gluten, or dairy) or offer an alternative for kids with allergies.  In addition to the safe candies I've listed below, other fun treat ideas are stickers, pencils, glow sticks, and other festive non-food items.  Thank you for your consideration!""  See how much less insulting, condescending, and demanding that sounds?"
"Handing candy out is NOT something that people have to do. If your child has allergies, go through their candy (as you should be doing anyways) and take out the things they can't have. Simple as that!!!"
"I'm sorry-this is ridiculous. I ditto every comment about checking your child's candy/responsible parenting. Also, teach your kids to take care of themselves. Kids with allergies should know what they can and can't eat. If they don't, it's a trip to the hospital. Allergies suck, but for every kid with allergies there's tons without. Halloween is a charitable holiday and no one should dictate what others choose to give out."
"This letter is very combative. While most people sympathize with those with allergies, it's the parent of the child responsibility to ensure the child gets the candy he/she can have. Most people buy bags of mixed candy- and in those bags contain things these kids are allergic to. And most people aren't going to to deviate from that to accommodate a few kids.
She could have her kid trick or treat and be happy, keep candy at home that her child CAN eat, and give away the candy collected that the child can't eat. 
Her letter was aggressive and puts people on the defensive."
"Too aggressive! If you are so worried about allergies you don't put your child in that situation. You let them go out, have fun and go buy them something that is safe for them. You and your child should know by now what's safe and what isn't. You should be checking their food all the time anyway! Don't expect the neighborhood thats been doing the same thing for years to change just for one person."
"NO"
"So by ""don't leave any children out of the fun"" she is disappointing every child without allergies when they get home to discover their bags full of carrots and raisins. I really hate these SJW's thinking everyone is entitled to do what they want. Natural selection would have dealt with her a long time ago."
"Parents are responsible for their children's health not the community."
"Guess what  I have  food allergy to anything with eggs or  food dies  leaves out pretty. Much everything   I am pretty happy that I found other things to make me fat.."
"You teach your child to deal with their allergies you do know expect the whole world to change for them. I have relatives with nut allergies and they do just fine avoiding nuts without expecting special treatment. Same as someone saying they are Jewish so their school can't have a Christmas party. People need to adapt and not expect special treatment."

"If it's just for symmetry then a reconstruction at same time of removal is the go. Walk in with 2 boobs,  walk out with 2 boobs, that's what I told my surgeon anyway, boobless was not an option and never should be"
"I choose and fought for a bilateral mastectomy, my surgeon did not want to remove the healthy breast and I told him ""you do it or I will find another Docter that will"", he agreed, there was no reconstruction and his proudest moment was when he told me he saved my tattoes...I am 14 years since that day and never looked back.."
"I have the exact same story, I mean I thought someone was writing about me. I had the VA hospital do a lumpectomy. They had promised before the surgery that I would have reconstruction. I have been fighting the VA for 5 1/2 years. Each time I went to a different doctor I was told it was about vanity, and plastic, not required surgery. I have one Brest barely a C cup on one side an E on the other. 
Finally  2days ago my implants were drained. For the first stage of reconstruction.  Buti ithas been forever until I had xrays done my back and neck are so bad that I had them drained during my first appointment just to relieve the wight"

"<U+272A><U+272A><U+272A> CANCER IS A VITAMIN-DEFICIENCY DISEASE by Richard Thripp: HOW TO CURE IT: DO NOT SUBMIT TO RADIO- & CRYO-ABLATIVE & CHEMO- <U+201C>THERAPIES<U+201D> <U+2014> TAKE PANCREATIC ENZYMES <U+2014> AVOID CERTAIN FOODS & HABITS <U+2014> TAKE VITAMIN B17 (1 to 6 grams daily on a full stomach) AND THE VITAMINS LISTED BELOW <U+2014> EAT THE CARCINOLYTIC FOODS LISTED BELOW <U+2014>

<U+201C>Therapeutic<U+201D> radiation, in any amount, harms living tissue. (Roentgen rays, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, x-radiation, ionizing radiation, corpuscular radiation can be implemented for diagnostic purposes, but never for therapeutic benefit.) Chemo- <U+201C>therapy<U+201D> poisons healthy tissue [necrocytotoxin <U+2013> a toxin that produces death of cells]. Of the 4 protocols in traditional (allopathic) cancer <U+201C>therapy<U+201D>: surgery (cutting), radiation (burning), cryo-ablation/cryosurgery (hypothermia) & chemo/chemical (poisoning/toxifying), only manual surgery possesses some legitimacy when malignant (cancerous) growth has reached a certain stage. It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, pokeberries, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress. A person whose<U+FEFF> diet is deficient in these nitrilosidic foods (those foods rich in Amygdalin, the substance of which the molecularity is 1 part: the natural analgesic<U+FEFF> benzaldehyde, 1 part: hydrogen cyanide, 2 parts: glucose) is incapable of stopping the over-production<U+FEFF> of healing cells<U+FEFF> thus this person has cancer. To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya. Supplement your diet with the nutrients (of which 95% of Americans are chronically deficient) that compliment Laetrile (vitamin B17):  <U+2460> zinc (which is the transport mechanism for Laetrile/vitamin B17) <U+2461> vitamin C (build up to 6 grams a day) <U+2462><U+FEFF> manganese <U+2463> magnesium <U+2464> selenium <U+2465> vitamins B6, B9 & B12 <U+2466> vitamin A <U+2467> vitamin E (at least 2,000 I.U.) 

A cheap, over-the-counter, urine-analysis pregnancy test is accurate in 92% of cases at detecting cancerous cell activity in the body. Men & women can test for cancer upon rising with a pregnancy test as cancer and pre-embryonic cells are virtually indistinguishable (in functionality) from cells designated as: adenocarcinomal, adenocarcinomic, ameboid, anaplastic, angiogenetic, angiogenic, astrocytomal, atypical, basal, blastocystic, cacoethic, cancerial, cancerian, cancerigenic, cancerigenical, cancerogenic, cancerogenical, cancroidal, cankerous, carcinoembryonic, carcinogenic, carcinogenical, carcinoidal, carcinomal, carcinomatoid, carcinomatous, carcinomic, carcinosarcomal, cholangiocarcinomal, dedifferentiated, dysplastic, embryonal, embryonic, embryonical, endometrial, endophytic, epithelial, epitheliomatous, endophytic, exophytic, extra-embryonic, fibroblastic, gestational, glioblastomal, H<U+00FC>rthle, hypermutable, hypermutagenic, leucaemicus, leukaemic, leukaemical, leukemic, leukemical, leukocythemic, leukocytomic, liposarcomal, lymphomal, lymphomic, macroglobulinemiac, malignant, malignantal, malignantic, malignus, melanocytic, melanomatous, melanotic, metastatic, metastatical, M<U+00FC>llerian, mutagenic, mutagenical, mutated, mutational, mycoplasmal, mycoplasmic, myelodysplastic, myelodysplastical, myelomal, myelomatoid, myelomonocytic, myelomonocytical, myeloproliferative, myxoid, myxoidic, necrogenic, necrogenous, neo-blastic, neo-embryonic, neo-fetal, neo-formative, neo-genetic, neo-genetical, neo-plasiac, neo-plasmic, neo-plastic, neo-plastigenic, odontogenic, oncogenic, oncologic, oncological, osteosarcomal, paraneoplastic, paraneoplastical, paraneoplastical, pathogenetic, pathogenetical, pathogenic, pathogenical, placental, placentational, pleiomorphic, pleomorphic, polymorphic, polymorphical, pluripotent, pre-cancerous, pre-embryonal, pre-leukemic, promyelocytic, promyelocytical, proto-embryonic, proto-leukemic, pre-squamous, proto-oncogenetic (gene), proto-tumorous, quasi-neoplastic, sarcomal, sarcomatous, squamous, toxicogenic, toxicogenomic, trophic, trophical, trophoblastic, trophoblastical, trophoplasmatic, trophoplasmic, tumefactive, tumefied, tumid, tumoral, tumorigenic, tumorlike, tumorous. Watch (available on You-Tube) G. Edward Griffin's ""World Without Cancer.""

IN BRIEF Concerning Cancer: 1. Take a pregnancy test just after waking up. For men a positive result means either cancer or a false positive. Take another test the next day. If a man gets 3 positive results then likely he has cancer somewhere. For women a positive result means (if she's able to become pregnant) she's pregnant or she has cancer, or she's pregnant and she has cancer, or a false positive (the test result is wrong). 

2. Several positive pregnancy test results = cancer. What next? STOP eating red meat, sugar, corn syrup. STOP drinking booze. STOP (or at least cut back on) smoking.

3. Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. Take vitamin B17 (at least 1 gram daily) and wheat grass and/or barley grass liquid or capsules (they're rich in vitamin B17), on a full stomach daily (you can't overdose on them ~ they're not poisonous). Take a zinc supplement. Take pancreatic enzymes.  

Since 2009 I have ordered vitamin B17 from Metabolic Products in California. 500 m.g. costs 87 cents. My mother is 80. She's been taking a gram per day for a year. Her pregnancy tests were positive in June 2013. They're negative now. I told her that she could cut her daily dose of vitamin B17 from 1,000 m.g. to 100 m.g. now that she's cancer-free but she insists on taking the high dose as it's made her fingernails harder and her hair thicker.

REVIEW: TAKE pregnancy tests to detect cancer. TAKE vitamin B17 (and as many of the listed vitamins as you can, especially zinc). Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. STOP eating red meat & cane sugar. It will take several weeks on B17 therapy to turn out negative pregnancy test results. The tumor WILL NOT shrink much even after the cancer is gone because only 10% of the tumor was cancer. The tumor MAY swell temporarily as the vitamin B17 kills malignant cells.

NOTE: Vitamin B17 therapy WILL NOT destroy the tumor! Vitamin B17 therapy will destroy the malignant cells (cancerous cells) of the tumor and within the tumor. Only 5% to 10% of the cells comprising a tumor are cancerous cells. In time the tumorous growth will be absorbed, in whole or in part. Unless the tumor is cosmetically displeasing, impinging nerves or blood vessels or hampering normal bodily function then let it be.

"<U+259D> <U+2599> <U+259D> <U+2599> The preventative, treatment & cure for insomnia and mental illnesses (including the diseases: anorexia & pellagra)<U+FEFF> is niacin (vit. B3). Research Dr. Abram Hoffer. Anorexia is a vitamin-deficiency disease. Psychological counseling is as effective w/anorexia as it is w/scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) or cancer/sickle-cell anemia/hypertension (vit. B17 deficiency). You can't talk, or reason, someone out of a chronic metabolic ailment<U+FEFF> anymore than you can slake a person's thirst by ruminating over their traumatic childhood. Anorexia is a sub-clinical symptom of the vitamin-deficiency disease pellagra. The preventative, treatment & cure is vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Niacin causes a false histamine reaction (prickly, red skin) that's harmless. You can build up a tolerance to niacin or take flush-free niacin. ALL who suffer from anorexia nervosa are deficient in the water-soluble vitamin B3. There is no known toxicity for B3. You won't O.D. on it. Excessive B3 ends up in the urine. Cancer is a disease of deficiency as is thirst & starvation. W/o water we die, no amt. of praying can change that fact of course as the Lord provides, thru His bounty, those things we need to survive. Indeed, Scripture stresses the importance of consuming seeds: ""Give us this day our daily bread,"" was written at a time<U+FEFF> when bread contained whole, raw seeds--seeds abounding in cancer-killing Amygdalin. <U+2013> Richard Thripp <U+259D> <U+2599><U+259D> <U+2599>"
"<U+265A> ""It now remains for the U.S.<U+FEFF> government to set a sensible example to the world by offering a bonus or yearly pension to all obviously unfit parents who allow themselves to be sterilized by harmless and scientific means. In this way the moron and the diseased would have no posterity to inherit their unhappy condition. The number of the feeble-minded would decrease and a heavy burden would be<U+FEFF> lifted from the shoulders of the fit."" --- Marge Sanger"

<U+201C>Therapeutic<U+201D> radiation, in any amount, harms living tissue. (Roentgen rays, electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, x-radiation, ionizing radiation, corpuscular radiation can be implemented for diagnostic purposes, but never for therapeutic benefit.) Chemo- <U+201C>therapy<U+201D> poisons healthy tissue [necrocytotoxin <U+2013> a toxin that produces death of cells]. Of the 4 protocols in traditional (allopathic) cancer <U+201C>therapy<U+201D>: surgery (cutting), radiation (burning), cryo-ablation/cryosurgery (hypothermia) & chemo/chemical (poisoning/toxifying), only manual surgery possesses some legitimacy when malignant (cancerous) growth has reached a certain stage. It is far better to avoid cancer than to treat it. Cancer is the body's inability to stop the process of healing, the same natural process in producing a placenta (that one pound organ attached to the uterine membrane which serves to nourish a developing baby). The essential anti-cancer vitamin is VITAMIN B17 (known as Amygdalin, and as Laetrile when synthesized from apricot pips). If you have cancer you must greatly reduce, or avoid: caffeine, tobacco, red meat, alcohol, corn syrup, cane sugar, tomato products. [U.S. cancer rates: the year 1900 : 3%; 1950 : 20%; 1972 : 27%; 1999 : 39%;<U+FEFF> by 2020 : 50%] 

VITAMIN B17 is abundant in these foods: the seeds of apples, loquats, pears, pumpkins, watermelons; as well as in apricot kernels, bamboo shoots, barley grass (research: Dr. Yoshihide Hagiwara) & wheat grass, beet tops, bitter almond, blackberries, boysenberries, brewers yeast, brown rice, buckwheat, cashews, cherry kernels, cranberries, currants, eucalyptus leaves, fava beans, flax seeds, garbanzo beans, gooseberries, guyabano, huckleberries, lentils, lima beans, linseed meat, loganberries, macadamia nuts, millet, millet seed, peach kernels, pecans, plum kernels, pokeberries, prickly ash bark, quince, raspberries, sorghum cane syrup, spinach, sprouts, tapioca (manioc), vetches and watercress. 
   A person whose<U+FEFF> diet is deficient in these nitrilosidic foods (those foods rich in Amygdalin, the substance of which the molecularity is 1 part: the natural analgesic<U+FEFF> benzaldehyde, 1 part: hydrogen cyanide, 2 parts: glucose) is incapable of stopping the over-production<U+FEFF> of healing cells<U+FEFF> thus this person has cancer. To aid the pancreas a patient should take pancreatic enzymes & eat fresh pineapple and papaya. Supplement your diet with the nutrients (of which 95% of Americans are chronically deficient) that compliment Laetrile (vitamin B17):  <U+2460> zinc (which is the transport mechanism for Laetrile/vitamin B17) <U+2461> vitamin C (build up to 6 grams a day) <U+2462><U+FEFF> manganese <U+2463> magnesium <U+2464> selenium <U+2465> vitamins B6, B9 & B12 <U+2466> vitamin A <U+2467> vitamin E (at least 2,000 I.U.) 

A cheap, over-the-counter, urine-analysis pregnancy test is accurate in 92% of cases at detecting cancerous cell activity in the body.

Watch (available on You-Tube) G. Edward Griffin's ""World Without Cancer.""

IN BRIEF Concerning Cancer: 1. Take a pregnancy test just after waking up. For men a positive result means either cancer or a false positive. Take another test the next day. If a man gets 3 positive results then likely he has cancer somewhere. For women a positive result means (if she's able to become pregnant) she's pregnant or she has cancer, or she's pregnant and she has cancer, or a false positive (the test result is wrong). 

2. Several positive pregnancy test results = cancer. What next? STOP eating red meat, sugar, corn syrup. STOP drinking booze. STOP (or at least cut back on) smoking.

3. Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. Take vitamin B17 (at least 1 gram daily) and wheat grass and/or barley grass liquid or capsules (they're rich in vitamin B17), on a full stomach daily (you can't overdose on them ~ they're not poisonous). Take a zinc supplement. Take pancreatic enzymes.  

Since 2009 I have ordered vitamin B17 from Metabolic Products in California. 500 m.g. costs 87 cents. My mother is 80. She's been taking a gram per day for a year. Her pregnancy tests were positive in June 2013. They're negative now. I told her that she could cut her daily dose of vitamin B17 from 1,000 m.g. to 100 m.g. now that she's cancer-free but she insists on taking the high dose as it's made her fingernails harder and her hair thicker.

REVIEW: TAKE pregnancy tests to detect cancer. TAKE vitamin B17 (and as many of the listed vitamins as you can, especially zinc). Eat fresh pineapple & papaya. STOP eating red meat & cane sugar. It will take several weeks on B17 therapy to turn out negative pregnancy test results. The tumor WILL NOT shrink much even after the cancer is gone because only 10% of the tumor was cancer. The tumor MAY swell temporarily as the vitamin B17 kills malignant cells.

NOTE: Vitamin B17 therapy WILL NOT destroy the tumor! Vitamin B17 therapy will destroy the malignant cells (cancerous cells) of the tumor and within the tumor. Only 5% to 10% of the cells comprising a tumor are cancerous cells. In time the tumorous growth will be absorbed, in whole or in part. Unless the tumor is cosmetically displeasing, impinging nerves or blood vessels or hampering normal bodily function then let it be.

For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

You can say something like this but make it from the heart::
                                OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN, I CONFESS TO YOU THAT I AM A SINNER THAT HAS SINNED AGAINST YOU. I ASK YOU TO PLEASE FORGIVE ME OF MY SINS. I BELIEVE JESIS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS FOR MY SINS, SHED ALL HIS BLOOD, WAS BURIED, AND ROSE THREE DAYS LATER ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES. I ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS MY LORD AND SAVIOUR AND ASK HIM TO SAVE MY SOUL WHEN I DIE. IN THIS I ASK IN JESUS CHRISTS NAME..AMEN"

"she should cover up when she is breastfeeding and  why not use a breast pump so that she doesn't have to whip her tit out in public.  I wouldn't like it very much if i saw that in public.  I believe its a personal private experience that the woman should only share with her baby."
"I agree. We as mothers do not need to expose our breast in public to feed our child. That's what receiving blankets are for. I would never expose my breast for all to see. I wouldn't like it either if I saw that. That's trying to attract unwanted attention. You can't be mad if people are offended by your exposed breast. Use a thin blanket or cover up and feed your child."
"By covering you're respecting yourself not others. I breastfeed all my kids in public. Most times people weren't even aware. A little modesty goes a long way."
"Looks to me she is the BULLIE! She exposed her breast fully and looked around for a fight! Since when does a breastfeeding mother pull her shirt DOWN , it's always Up so you are some what covered by your shirt! She did this to get attention! A breastfeeding mother is tuned into her child, looking directly into there eyes , holding there hand , caressing there head while they are feeding, she is not, she is looking around to start trouble!"
"I have no issues what so ever of a women nursing in public. It's a natural occurrence, but YES, she should cover herself. She looks trashy. I wouldn't want my young son looking at your bare breast. Have some respect for yourself, your baby and the public."
"I never breastfed in public, only because I didn't feel comfortable. I do think women should be able to do it though wherever the need to, but please, be discreet! No-one (who is normal) wants to see everything"
"Seriously? I'm amazed at how many people are offended by a woman breastfeeding their child but not by any of the advertisements that plague billboards and TV commercials using woman barely wearing clothing to promote merchandise."
"She is one who wanted to go viral now she has...naked women breastfeeding on her page.. I said she liked exposing herself and was using that baby as an excuse!!"
"I think Women should be able to breast feed anyplace BUT!!!! There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON that she can't cover her breast, not saying throw a towel over the babies head just put a small towel or ANYTHING over your breast. You've taken it to far!"
"There's lots of women breast feed in public but they do it without exposing themselves to this extent...unnecessary in my opinion."
"Im Swedish and we breastfeed in public and go topless on the beach so boobs on display is no issue here.... BUT, the way this woman gives her well rehearsed "" come back answer"" makes it almost seem like she is provoking people."
"No woman should ever have to cover to feed her baby!!!"
"Why don't you feed your baby at home?"
"Kudos to her!!! Feed your baby anyway/anyplace you want."

"I understand it's natural and all but it doesn't mean we have to have it shoved down our throats. No pun intended."
"does this mean i get to take a piss on a main street during the day? its a natural thing. please cover up, just for the simple fact that there is alot of freaky guys out there."
"Why would she not cover up while In public? ???"
"I believe that some mothers love the attention.."
"She wants attention. She's searching for people with the sole intention to make them feel uncomfortable, begging for confrontation. Cover up, it's simple and easy."

"Back in the 1960s, a few studies found high levels of aluminum in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The research suddenly called into question the safety of everyday household items such as aluminum cans, antacids, and antiperspirants.

But the findings of these early studies weren<U+2019>t replicated in later research, and experts have essentially ruled out aluminum as a possible cause of Alzheimer's.

""There was a lot of research that looked at the link between Alzheimer's and aluminum, and there hasn't been any definitive evidence to suggest there is a link,"" says Heather M. Snyder, PhD, senior associate director of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer's Association.

Breast Cancer Survival: Early Detection Still Key
According to the experts interviewed for this story, the aluminum in antiperspirants doesn't even typically make its way into the body.

""The aluminum salts do not work as antiperspirants by being absorbed in the body. They work by forming a chemical reaction with the water in the sweat to form a physical plug... which is deposited in the sweat duct, producing a blockage in the areas that it's applied,"" says David Pariser, MD, professor of dermatology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and past president of the American Academy of Dermatology. ""Even [with] nicks from shaving, the amount is so negligible that it doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense.""

"I'm not giving up my antiperspirant... It took me too long to find one that actually works for me.  I'll take the risk.

On the issue of talc, folks who use it can try baby powder instead."
"Really when baby powder has been proven to cause cancer to,,dah///and the aluminum in underarm deoderant is killing people to,your gonna think twice,when you are fighten for your life,and have no hair, smarten up please,"

"This is beautiful! When I had my first son the nurses were jerks. They would push his head to nurse and to latch on then rub his face into my chest. I was pissed off as all hell,emotional and frustrated that he wouldn't latch on but i felt like they were rough. All she told me was "" he has to latch on and babies are very flexible and resilient to being hurt, he's fine you're getting too emotional over nothing"" i wanted to punch her in the face honestly. The hospitals in the USA should do this but they don't...they take the baby right away wash it,dry it then give it to you for breastfeeding. :( I didn't nurse neither of my sons though I dried up pretty quick...with my first was after 2 weeks and my 2 son made it almost a month with being bottle fed the breastmilk."
"Kourtney Smith... Ethel Smith..  Helen McGee Juanita Hill.   Haki Peace Montano Peace Montano Nandi Castro. 

Watch this little juicy baby slowly  scoot toward breakfast.

I remember  the first time I realized babies will try to come and get it when they're  hungry.  When Abasi was a baby I woke up in the middle of the night with my nipple in his mouth. Straight getting his grub on. I almost hit him cause  I thought  something was biting me. He's  still the first one to get in line for food to this day."
"Wow . No need to slam the baby on to its mom like that.  Totally careless. That nurse needs to do something other then labor & delivery. She is going to injury/kill a baby before too long."
"As a nurse I have seen this..It is awesome.  Hospitals are to quick to remove baby and do all the measuring..bathing..etc to allow Mims yo experience this."

"I wish my mum thought of doing something before she died."
"MARK 16:15 AND HE SAID UNTO THEM, GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.

1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
By which also ye are saved, if keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

ROMANS 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

1 JOHN 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

God loves you so very much:))

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

1JOHN 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye believe on the name of the Son of God.

God loves you so very much! All of us are sinners in this world who have sinned and rebelled against a holy righteous God and because of sin we have to face death one day. Sin is the reason we die.God came down to earth as a man in the flesh named Jesus Christ. Jesus became the light of the world to save sinners from their sins. Jesus died on the cross for your sins, shed all of his blood, was buried, and rose again three days later, according to the scriptures. He took your place of punishment for your sins so if you truly believe in your heart on Jesus and all that he did for you and put your faith and trust in his blood that was shed for your sins and trust in all he did for you on the cross, you may know that you have everlasting life and you will be saved the very moment you truly believe in your heart. God sees the heart of man. Will you believe on Jesus Christ today with all of your heart and trust on him and the shed blood that was shed for your sins?

Jesus is God manifested in the flesh!!!

JOHN 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

JOHN 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way. No man, priest, pastor, church, religion, works, baptism, nothing but through Jesus Christ!

JOHN 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

ACTS 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

JOHN 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

1 PETER 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

We are all sinners and we are going to die one day and need to be saved from our sins to go to heaven

ROMANS 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

ROMANS 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROMANS 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

We are saved ONLY by GOD'S GRACE!

EPHESIANS 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

ROMANS 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

REPENT, turn to Jesus Christ, put your faith and trust in him alone, truly believe on him and all he did for you.

JOHN 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

MARK 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

EPHESIANS 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise,

When you truly believe on Jesus with all of your heart call upon him from your heart..Salvation is a heart decision and comes from the heart.

ROMANS 10: 9-13 If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

The very second you BELIEVE in your heart on Jesus Christ and all he did for you on the cross for your sins cause God sees your heart and call upon the name of the Lord from your heart you will be saved. Salvation is a heart decision..Whoever comes to Jesus Christ he will in no wise cast out..Come to Jesus today and  get saved today.."

Breasts were sexualized in the bible.  The song of psalms is all about the power of a nice set of knockers.  It's only natural for men to be aroused by them.  It's part of human nature.  To ask a man to turn off thousands of years of biological brain wiring is absurd.  Anybody that's into shaming men for being turned on by breasts has a few loose screws in my book.  It's all just a matter of respect.  No reason to bash each other over it."

"An inherent brain malnutrition problem which relates to REM sleep, taichi, heart rate stimulation therapy, lifestyle, & chronic diseases/imbalances:- A moderate increase of heart rate (HR) WITHOUT body movement, stress hormone, and food in stomach, could be the only way to facilitate full microcirculations deep inside your brain and other organs (to replenish nutrients and detox at cell level). Unfortunately, this happens only in short bursts during REM sleeps (see below web link), though oxygen exchange is non-stop for the brain. It happens even more rarely during day time because busy city folks find it tough to meet the 4 criteria mentioned above. Whereas, microcirculation for muscle cells (by simple movements to increase HR) comes easily. That is why many muscle men with malnourished brain cells still succumb to chronic diseases. Though wine/coffee/acupuncture/stretching/cannabis (before meals), and other heart rate stimulation therapies (e.g. electric/heat/qigong/Holy water/African drums/urine) can provide the same healing effect, it will disappear in a few weeks once you get used to the stimulant. Increased dosage may lead to serious consequences. The most efficient way is to do EXTRA SLOW taichi for 30 minutes before meals. This will earn you 30 min of brain perfusion, which is the same as a good 7-hour sleep (see below web link). Or else, you must spend 1 - 3 hours a day to do 30 sets of normal taichi /aerobics /sun salutations, or simply slow walks. But you MUST stop/meditate 1 to 2 min after each set in order to earn 1 min of perfusion time. Incidentally, this is equal to a 9-hole golf game (on foot of course) where you have to walk-and-stop 30 times. Do it everyday.

If you have chronic diseases, you should avoid all endurance exercises (marathon, lap-swimming, etc.), unless you train with the abovementioned exercises to repair internal damages (but easily cause joint and heart damages). By now, you should know the differences between active living with many breaks (which is healthy living even without exercises), active living without breaks, and a complete sedentary lifestyle. The latter two can be fatal. 

Chronic brain malnutrition can cause cell mutations in the brain which will slowly affect all downstream organs. That is why a remission after a successful operation cannot last long if the patient continues to live the old lifestyle with the same old brain. This microcirculation theory applies to all exercises, brain growth, cell mutation, chronic diseases, sleep, and people from 4 to 95. Some diseases (e.g. Alzheimer<U+2019>s, HIV, lead poisoning<U+2026>) become more difficult to treat once they affect patients<U+2019> rem sleep, and they usually do. 

Hope that Beijing can revert their taichi speeds back to the slower speed used before 1956, and apply the new knowledge to medical procedures and medicines, for the benefits of mankind.

"MARK 16:15 AND HE SAID UNTO THEM, GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.

1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
By which also ye are saved, if keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

ROMANS 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

1 JOHN 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

2 CORINTHIANS 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

God loves you so very much:))

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

1JOHN 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye believe on the name of the Son of God.

God loves you so very much! All of us are sinners in this world who have sinned and rebelled against a holy righteous God and because of sin we have to face death one day. Sin is the reason we die.God came down to earth as a man in the flesh named Jesus Christ. Jesus became the light of the world to save sinners from their sins. Jesus died on the cross for your sins, shed all of his blood, was buried, and rose again three days later, according to the scriptures. He took your place of punishment for your sins so if you truly believe in your heart on Jesus and all that he did for you and put your faith and trust in his blood that was shed for your sins and trust in all he did for you on the cross, you may know that you have everlasting life and you will be saved the very moment you truly believe in your heart. God sees the heart of man. Will you believe on Jesus Christ today with all of your heart and trust on him and the shed blood that was shed for your sins?

Jesus is God manifested in the flesh!!!

JOHN 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

JOHN 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven! There is no other way. No man, priest, pastor, church, religion, works, baptism, nothing but through Jesus Christ!

JOHN 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

ACTS 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD!

JOHN 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

1 PETER 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

We are all sinners and we are going to die one day and need to be saved from our sins to go to heaven

ROMANS 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

ROMANS 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

ROMANS 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROMANS 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

We are saved ONLY by GOD'S GRACE!

EPHESIANS 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

ROMANS 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

REPENT, turn to Jesus Christ, put your faith and trust in him alone, truly believe on him and all he did for you.

JOHN 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

MARK 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

EPHESIANS 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise,

When you truly believe on Jesus with all of your heart call upon him from your heart..Salvation is a heart decision and comes from the heart.

ROMANS 10: 9-13 If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

The very second you BELIEVE in your heart on Jesus Christ and all he did for you on the cross for your sins cause God sees your heart and call upon the name of the Lord from your heart you will be saved. Salvation is a heart decision..Whoever comes to Jesus Christ he will in no wise cast out..Come to Jesus today and  get saved today.."

After chemo, radiation, and a double mastectomy with reconstruction, I am a cancer survivor! Nine years and counting. If you are diagnosed with dense breasts, be pro active. It could save your life!"

"I have dense breast tissue, so was recommended to have ultrasounds in conjunction with mammograms. They found the largest (2mm) of my breast cancers with the ultrasound, the mammogram didn't pick it up.  Neither of them picked up the remaining 5 tiny tumours. I doubt I'd still be here without the ultrasound. Was it worth the money?..... you bet your arse it was! On the bright side, I only have mammograms on my remaining breast now, so that's a saving!!"
"I also have dense breast tissue, and was also recommended to go for a mammogram....then for an ultra sound. After the ultra sound they took another two mammograms so in total I had THREE mammograms in one day!  WTF.... I however still have a brown discharge(golden syrup with a bloody undertone)  coming from my left breast,  my neck arms and chest is bruised and has a horrible discolouration. No MORE mammograms for me I had it!"
"I just got my report- extremely dense, >75%.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer 3 years ago, when I found a lump 5 months after a ""normal"" mammogram.  Ugh!"
"Get 3D mammogram
they charged 
me $10 more for copay
but worth it and it reduces biopsy as they 
results same day
are more accurate"

God bless all of you who are undergoing breast cancer treatment! You are beautiful and you are very brave!"
"It has been 6 years ago for me, still very fresh in my mind on a daily bases. I too shaved my head, I also had Bilateral Mastectomy. Best thing I could have ever done. Bless you and stay strong, you have a long life to live. It's only hair, it comes back. As far as breasts no big deal, your life is more important. Best of luck to you"
"I had m6 son shave my hair because there was no way in hell I was going to let the cancer rule my life."
"God Bless you Shannen.  You will be just fine.  This is a journey, not a fun one but one that I hate you have to experience.  I am a 3 year survivor.  You are young and strong.  I had a hard time losing my hair, but once it was gone and then you start having hot flashes, you will feel better.  Do you know why I think we lose our hair?  Because God knows how tired you get during chemo and the last thing you feel like doing is fixing your hair.  But the good thing is you won't have to worry about shaving your legs, arm pits and your VaJJ  LOL.  Take care and you will be ok."
"I also did the same I faught off 3 types of cancer.... it just shows bravery. Took me a very long time to go public but when I lady came up to me and said never hide behind what I'm fighting and that's life. I took off my hat and faught cancer proudly. Way to go to her.

"I've just done the same after 2 weeks of chemo session number 1. I feel that is has given me some control, we can kick cancers ass ladies!"
"Majority of us shave our heads rather than see it fall. Being a celebrity I guess makes it braver. But it does I guess help those who are afraid to just do it. And it does grow back."
"Just curious...why do many women shave their head after cancer diagnosis? (Please don't take this wrong). I thought radiation makes that happen anyways."
"I wore the cold cap so didn't loose all my hair.....people used to say to me that their friends/family had had it worse than me cos they lost all their hair....used to really upset me"
"Don't be afraid to try a wig. My hair came back, and I had scalp treatments and used Renee Fureratur Hair products. My hair is not thick, but thin and strong."
"As a survived, I can tell you it's not a walk in the park, but attitude of yes I will does wonders. Prayer every day too. Kick it girl."

"Good luck Shannon, I have been there and I am still here on earth!!"
"14 years and still counting DON'T give up the fight!!!!"
"We lose our hair because the medicine is working. It'll grow back its only hair. Hair is dead anyway, just like nails.5 yrs ago for me"
"My sister shaved my head. It is a lot easier then watching it fall out a little at a time."
"Been there, done that! Praying for her! I'm a survivor now and she will be too."

"While ear infections may be ""minor"" they can lead to bigger issues and the are very very painful. This article is an awesome and more people need to think this way. Many people have made comments saying chrohns isn't a big deal well yes it is when your giving your child shots weekly not knowing how long they will be healthy. Is it the same as cancer? No but the end result is these kids all are hurting"
"As the mother of a cancer patient (or another life threatening disease), ear infections are minor. You are acting like any other of a seriously ill child would."

"I dont know what your going through but family support laughter and plenty of inner strength is needed were all praying for you and hope you get well"
"I pray that you make it through this , Shannen. I know you don't know me, but, as a fan, and a fellow human being, I know you need all of the support and compassion that you can get, during this difficult time. God can do anything, may the Lord bless you and your family."
"Shannen Doherty, you probably wont see this but first off, I am so sorry you're going through this. I grew up with you, watching you, and I have good thoughts for you. My mother had breast cancer that spread to her lymph nodes. It was called inflammatory breast cancer and If I remember correctly, stage 4. There wasn't much hope back then. I think I was a junior in high school so around 1991/1992 we found out. She fought like hell and never stopped working. She even finished college. Yes, she was exhausted but she knew what she had to do.  During everything she had surgery, radiation and chemo. Eventually she had to have a heart transplant. That took place on my 30th birthday, so almost 12 years ago. She is still here. Its rough sometimes, she was depressed, she was happy, she wanted to give up, she wanted to fight, she wanted to not be sick...but she was. The good days are much better than the bad days. You can do this. One thing I would say is try to keep a high amount of green foods. I'm sure you know about all this. My mom used to get something from someone named Dr. Sun. It was some very unpleasant soup that would come frozen and she ate that. Not sure where Dr. Sun is or if he is still around. I know you can win. Don't ever give up on your life and always look towards tomorrow and plan something small but great for the next day. HOLD ON."
"Much Love Sweetie...I went thru 2 different chemos every 3 weeks for 8 months. One into a port in my chest.  And the other thru a spinal tap. Both back to back every 3 weeks. I'm praying for you"
"Shannon I am so very sorry for what you are going thru.. I also have been there and no one knows the feelings it brings  out in you. the fears it instills in you that never ever go away.. Make sure they are doing the best of the best and if you are not happy with them go find someone else.. You are your' best advocate.. Fight lilke HELL!!!!"
"Is that picture of her and her mother? It took my breath away. I cant imagine what she is going through, somehow that picture gives me a glimpse of it. Stay strong, beautiful!"

BEWARE_THE VISITOR!!!!
""What can I do?""  This coming from me, the one who is never at a loss for what to do.

""What can I say?"" This coming from someone who hasn't shut up in more years than most have lived.

 A new visitor has moved into our home.

This visitor has sucked the life out of a once happy place and moves from room to room to make sure no ounce of life is existing. The visitor has taken over what we eat, what we think, choices we make and just is a nuisance in everything that we had hoped for the future.

The visitor moves fast, doesn't apologize and always leaves the impression that no one is in control but it. Snarling, laughing, holding on tight are all the unwelcome  gestures from the visitor. We want to punch, hit, hurt and maim but this visitor has an impenetrable skin and holds strong against all attacks by us.

Crying, hurting, lashing out has no bearing on the visitor's soul. The more we hurt, the more it intrudes. Hate is such a strong word but is the only clean adjective to describe this life altering force that has physically and mentally drained all the want of life out of us.

Everyone gives different ideas about how to rid our lives of this beast but nothing seems to even move it anywhere near out of our life.

Watch out for the visitor. Guard yourself with everything you can because once it comes, it doesn't want to leave.

The visitor's name is cancer."
"If it is true that cancer cells travel via the blood stream, why is donated blood not screened for cancer cells, and why is the public not being warned by the health authorities of the risks of coming in contact with the blood of a cancer patient?

"I had a right side radical mastectomy in Jan 2012 with lymph node involvement and removal followed by chemo then radiation. I'm cancer free so far. Lymphedema is a pain in the arm and shoulder... but I""m very much alive and I have a future <3"
"My mother had breast cancer and hers had spread to her lymph nodes as well. Her first year after her mastectomy and chemo, they gave her a 10% chance of survival. As the years passed, and she was cancer free, her chances of survival increased. She has now been cancer free for 30 years. She has quite a story to tell. Hang in there, my prayers are with you for a speedy recovery. <3"
"My breast cancer also spread to my lymph nodes, also had them removed and after 6 months of chemo and 6 weeks(everyday) of radiation back in 2011, I am now 5 years cancer free as of June 26th. Kia Kaha (stay strong in Maori) Shannen <3"
"Was dx'd in 2010. Stage 3, ER/PR + invasive lobular carcinoma. Complete mastectomy, chemo and radiation. 9 out of 16 lymph nodes removed had cancer. I'm now six years out. You can do this!!"
"Don't be so scared , it is quite common for breast cancer to spread to the lymph nodes, they are doing their job :  stopping the cancer to go to other part of your body. Stay positive , many people are thinking of you , praying , sending their love and good vibes. Keep fighting you will win this battle :) Rest well , eat when you feel like it , drink plenty fluids. I am a breast cancer survivor, 4 years. Take care , best wishes for the future xxx from London."
"Im sorry....I wish they would find a cure for cancer and It doesn't matter what kind of cancer it is.....my husband has kidney cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes, both lungs and now the bone...so it doesn't matter what type of cancer it is, it is just as equally devastating....Shannen I will keep you in my prayers...."
"I know how it feels. I'm for sure stage III but perhaps stage IV. Anxiety meds are keeping me from going off the cliff in addition to being left with horrid side effects of chemo and rads. Get used to the unknown. Once you have cancer you are at risk to have all cancers as I'm finding out. Even meds you take to help prevent it from coming back can cause cancer. It's a life long vigil and stress. Visit breastcancer.org. So much info there that you will never get from any docs."
"I've just finished my 2nd battle with breast cancer... just like the first time I don't worry about my future... I just think about living and being blessed that I beat that evil demon once again... live life to the fullest, smile, and laugh as much as possible... I didn't expect this either time it happened and will not expect if it comes back... life is short so live... live for urself and those warriors that are watching out for us above... enjoy each day.."
"I had a lumpectomy on the left in 2002, followed by radiation. Then a mastectomy on the right in 2006. Last mammogram showed me still cancer free after 10 years. I am now 73 years old and feel great. My prayers are with you, Shannen."
"My breast cancer had not spread to the lymph nodes for which I am extremely grateful, but i still had chemo and radiation as a preventative measure.  Been 7 years and am still cancer free.  But there is one thing I don't understand..reading the article it said she was diagnosed in Feb 2015 but didn't have surgery till this past May?  I certainly hope that was a misprint because if that really happened, then she needs a new doctor."
"Hang in there. I had cancer  with lymph nodes and chemo and radiation. It worked for 14 years. Than in 2013 I had a double mastectomy so far so good. Praying for you."
"I had breast cancer twice in the same place. Had a mastectomy and radiation. Been cancer free since 2006. Prayers are with you Shannen. I agree with Laura, stay positive and strong"

"My heart goes out to Shannen brought back all I went through 11 years ago.  Fortunately I had a Lumpectomy, but chemo which brought on the hair loss and nausea, radiation whole bit it was horrible.  Still after all this time still freak when it's time for the annual check.  Shannen stay strong you can do this you are a warrior and beat this dreaded enemy.  God Bless."
"I had Breast Cancer with 3 lymph nodes involved and i'm living a good life. Just have a bone density test done chemo can give you bone loss which i now have. It's either the Prolia Shot or I.V.'s for me which ever the Insurance company will pay for."
"Horrible news for Shannen. I hope she stays strong and gets through it! Today marks 18 years since I love my mother to breast cancer and a close friend of mine is also battling it, having just had a double mastectomy and now finding that it has spread to her lymph nodes as well.

My thoughts are with all of you battling this dragon - we'll slay it together!"
"I just found out yesterday I am cancer free. I had stage two breast cancer. I went through a mastectomy and chemo. Look to God and most importantly stay positive!!!!"
"Shannen you keep fighting with everything you have.I had Breast cancer in 2003 i did the Chemo but didnt want to do the Rad.I had the worst chemo.YOU NEED Loving Family and GREAT FRIENDS.YOU WILL MAKE IT THRU THIS,HANG IN THERE LADY."
"Shannen you have to keep a positive attitude and your loved ones around. I am a 5 year survivor. I found my cancer stage 2 at age 37 with lymph node invovlement. I have a double mastectomy, chemo and radiation. I have been fine, but currently we found another tumor which may have been caused by the radiation. we are doing tests to see if it is cancerous now, praying it is not. Stay strong and know you have a whole sisterhood out hear to help you through your journey. Best wishes and prayers coming your way."
"Shannon Doherty, go to the Bio-Med center in Tijuana Mx, my feirnd beat her cancer there no chem, no radiation, she had lymphatic cancer, good luck"
"I had breast cancer in 1993 lost both parents when young to cancer mine had gone into lymph nodes took 8 out gone into 2 had a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy then radiotherapy 23 yrs on am really a very healthy 70 yr old so hope this gives you hope take care and go with whatever your body tells you be easy on yourself lots of love xx"
"Three years cancer free I had chemo and radiation lymph nodes out you have to think positive and you will get through it God bless"
"I have cancer also!! The main part was my left kidney!! Renal cancer and it spread to my left ribs and chest.. I had surgery done in April of this year 2016.. I stay strong, positive and have lots of faith in God.. Shannen I live by this don't give up!! Never give up!!!! I'm a fighter!! Just believe everything will be good... Keep positive all the time!! Love life"
"I had breast cancer 8 years ago now, When I had my first surgery they injected 4 needles into my nipple at the time, right before surgery that went into my nodes,So they also while removing the cancer took the nodes as well. They caught it early so I had a lumpectomy and no cancer in my nodes, also a PET scan done right away as well. I than had chemo and radiation. I took tamoxifen for 5 years. My Mother had died from breast cancer so they was all over it, It has been 8 years an here I am. So stay positive an Let it be in  Gods hands. GOD BLESS Shannen, an as I said dont fear it."
"I'm a breast cancer survivor - 8 years now.  I was fortunate that my nodes weren't involved; however, I worked with a lady who had several nodes positive.  She chose a double mastectomy & chemotherapy - she's still doing well and it's been at least 15 years!  Try very hard not to borrow all the 'what ifs' from the future, but live each & every day...one day at a time.  Find something, no matter how small, to be thankful for each day.  The Bible tells us not to borrow problems from tomorrow for the present has enough of its own!  Don't waste the time you have, whatever that might be, on worrying about things you can't control - look for some joy in every day!  God bless you and provide you with peace & hope"
"cancer is scary stuff... period!  I've never been a fan of hers, but she is human and going through a lot.  I watched lung cancer suck the life out of my dad in a years time.  So I feel for and empathize with everybody having to deal with this horrible, horrible illness."
"I am a survivor, 12 years out now. I had chemo, natural suppliments AND deep massage therapy and reflexology. The massage therapy moves the chemo around to reach ALL areas of the body. I have no residual effects from chemo and I'm STILL here! I highly recommend the additional massage therapy and reflexology to help heal a diseased body."
"Twelve year survivor, mine had spread to one node, didn't have chemo just rads....sometimes the treatment is worse than the disease...rads caused heart failure after 11yrs, but I'm still here and extremely positive..."
"I went through breast cancer lumpectomy, chemo & radiation too. I just made my 4 year mark free...it is a hard road but NEVER ever give up...Keep fighting Keep living Keep listening and enjoying. When I had the cancer I sat at home one day at my computer listening to the birds outside. Really listening to them. It was so beautiful. I was so aware of the nature all of a sudden. LOVE LIFE Shannon Doherty...take care..."
"The biggest thing she can be telling people is NOT to do  what she did. She waited months before having her cancer treated. I saw her on a program where she knew she had it but had not started any kind of treatment for it out of fear. I am a breast cancer survivor. Please....keep up with your mammograms and if you get diagnosed be brave enough to treat it. I wish her all the best in her journey. It's a hard one but stay strong you can survive this!"
"I am praying that Ms Dohertys cancer treatments will put her cancer in remission as there is one God who watches over all of us."
"have you ever heard of sour sop, my best friend had breast cancer 6 years ago, yes...she did chemo and radiation...and sour sop...she's now cancer free...but contineously drinking sour sop pure juice and boiling sour sop leaves for her drink daily. Sour Sop fights cancer cells from mutating...it won't hurt to try...I don't have one but I do drink too ( sour sop )."
"I wonder why the Doctors didn't remove some Lymph nodes to try to stop the cancer from spreading. I had my breast cancer operation in June 2001 and they took something like 11 (I think) anyway they took Lymph Nodes from my right underarm. I then had x amount of chemo and then everyday radiation. I've now been cancer free for 15 years"
"My dad died from cancer and my mom is a breast cancer survivor. Theres nothing i hate more than this disease. If my mom can beat it, shannon can!! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C>"
"Steroid meds helped me tremendously, the first 3 treatments made me very ill but when I told my oncologist, he switched me to the steroids and I wasn't ill again. Losing your hair isn't bad either, is all in your attitude. My son and 2 small grandsons and I had a ""bald"" party where we all buzzed our heads, made it fun. Attitude is so important. Been 5 years now, I wish her and everyone else traveling this journey the best of luck"
"One breast removed and 17 lymph nodes removed....no chemo, no radiation....I wanted to live and that's exactly what I'm doing.....without the medicine....no worries....so get over yourself....Shannen....you are positively one of us millions of women dealing with it...the only difference...is we didn't go public......."
"I went through it as well, just this year.  Go into surgery thinking it's only going to be a mastectomy, find out two-weeks later that it was going to have to be so much more.  I'm only 6-weeks out from radiation and still suffering side-effects from chemo, but it's worth it to be alive."
"I too have cancer and it has spread to liver and lymph nodes. I have lost my hair but Shannen, keep fighting with all that you have. Rely on your strength even if you feel you don't have the strength, trust me, there is more to use. God bless you always."
"I just got done with chemo and radiation .I had cancer in my right breast and it was in my limp nods also. Keep a positive attitude and have faith in God . Chemo is rough on your body.,you can handle it you are a strong woman..I will pray for you.Just dont forget keep a positive attitude,,"
"You can share your stories and I know they are helpful however breast cancer as with any disease is different for anyone. My cousin is a breast cancer survivor. She was 21 when she was diagnosed with it and had no family history. I can understand why Shannen is worried about her future. I pray that she sees all of these up lifting stories and I am praying for comfort and healing for her."
"Keep fighting your positive will to live is your cure I had stage 4 and have been beating the odds for 2 years now, it was not breast cancer but it was cancer and I was dying."
"I have 2 sisters who have had breast cancer. They are cancer free now ten years later. I don't know if you will even see my note, but please be strong, it's so important to stay strong. Don't give up, fight it hard, and stay strong. Hugs to you."
"This happened to me twice. Diagnosed in 2008 at the age of 34 and again in 2012 at the age of 37. Both times in my nodes. You got this Shannen. The positive to take away from your journey is we have wonderful facilities, doctors, nurses and modern medicine.  It also looks like you have a wonderful support system which is half of the battle. Granted no cancer diagnosis is the same. We all have our own story to tell. However, in this day and age this is a beatable disease. I am proof of that."
"My mom was diagnosed early on and had a lumpectomy & radiation. She is doing well, I had genetic testing to see if I was a carrier which I am not. But I pray everyday I don't have to go thru what these brave and courageous women have to endure."
"It makes me sad to see this kind of stuff...  I really don't wish it on my worst enemy...I just want her up fall off the face of the earth....  <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+00B3>

I was 3b nasopharyngeal cancer.  You've probably never heard of it.  It's a head and neck cancer...  I've had my uvula, and tonsils radiated away...

My cancer was head and neck...

I hope you can still TALK shit for me.  

Until then, get it, own it, conquer it."
"Stage III in 2009. Identical treatment. I went to work as usual except on chemo days. It wasn't fun but I don't like playing a victim. I'm still plugging along at age 67. No reconstructive surgery."
"How many of you know this----cancer cells feeds off of sugar---How does doctors explain how a 10 year old can die of lung cancer never smoked a day in her short life?..My father in law...was being doctored for the flu---six week later---they told him he had cancer in his lymph nodes----I ask my self----when I let the thought of love ones who has died from cancer to enter back into my mind--How much are we lied to by doctor and scientists?"
"I pray that Shannen beats this disease! Keep fighting! Breast cancer can be defeated, there are many survivors out there, cheering you on!

"I am so sorry to hear about all the breast cancer patients and sincerely wish them the very best in life and hope they will turn to God for answers as they battle this horrible affliction."
"Stage three it spread to six of my lypnods and started on chest wall! Just one small cell but enough to cause panic to me.I had a double mastectomy the six lymph nodes removed. My tumor was almost a ten I had 23 sessions of the harshes chemo and 48 radiation treatments! They got all my cancer but one cell that had started on my chest wall so 48 sessions of the radiation burnt the cell up! July 18th 2016 marked a year and a half cancer free!!!! Your always going to have fear that will never leave. But always have your faith in God and always stay positive! Never let your mind bring negativity! Good luck and God bless all!"
"Your in my prayers! Trilled that a lot of people beat this dam disease and the people going through this hard time my heart goes out to you all and prayers!

I hate cancer and it's a disease that hurts the entire family and it needs more funding in the hands of researchers not organizations that pay their CEOs $$$$$ to run their org! Prayers to all that are going to kick the hell out of cancer."
"Shannon , I ask the Good Lord to bless you and take away this terrible disease!! I ask him to give you extra strength through this terrible time that you  have to endure!! Stay positive!! My mom passed away from breast cancer 46 years ago at the age of 53. The doctor's have come a long long way of helping surviving Cancer patients!! Keep your faith and  trust in the Lord!!

"Praying for remission!  Just out of curiosity, and I know it's not legal everywhere, but would possibly trying cannibis oil help at all? I've read stories that it has help some cancer patients."
"So many of us went through this...glad she has money...without it ..it was tough. Eat well..no preservatives..no red meat or pork...Juice with organic fruits and many veggies...No preservatives ..lots of room temp water.  not from the tap..no sugar or alcohol..ever...any alcohol will do much harm.  Wear just cotton..use only Dove products..no hair dye, no mani/pedi's for now..etc.  .Use .Baking soda ..to keep your PH to 7.3 7.6...sleep 8 to 10 hrs a day in a room at 67 degrees...Stay away from crowds..Good Luck.  Sorry I had to add on...I beat breast cancer a dozen years ago..Did go through ..3 operations..leaving my breast in..just partials...where the cancer was...then 6 weeks of day to day into Manhattan for Radiation, during 911,  in Memorial Sloan Kettering....which I believe gave my body so much life long pain and problems.and asthma from the dust particles.   PT works wonders. as does an Allergist to rebuild .Oh..and keep a diary of what you eat and drink , weight....and pray."
"A strict organic ""Alkaline"" diet for 60 days kills all cancer in the body. The public has been duped by the medical societies. We are being killed by the poisons in all of our food and liquids."
"I'm so very sorry for her and I will be praying!! I lost my Mom to breast cancer just over a year ago, she was very sick in the end. I wouldn't wish this on anyone."
"Praying for you Shannen.  I am a cancer survivor, and I agree, the unknown is the scariest part.  But stay strong young lady."
"Prayers to you all and to Shannen. On one thread some woman had the audacity to criticize Shannen's skin and say with her money she should have had taken better care of herself I guess she is uneducated and has never watched what cancer does to the body, skin, hair. Advances are being made every day and hoping one day for a cure!"
"My Mom (R.I.P.) had hers removed in 1998. She lost her life when the cancer came back and spread in 2013. God bless you Shannen, to you and your family. Stay strong. Fight the good fight."
"I don't love this news, but I'm sending Shannon love, plus prayers for a complete healing from breast cancer. Blessings to you Shannon. Please stay strong. You will beat this breast cancer."
"Cancer, is just too horrible for Me to talk about. This BASTARD DISEASE is taking ALL of My Family. I have a Nephew, that is only 51, and it's through his Body, and He's tried, EVERYTHING. There is NOTHING, more they can do for him, unless His insurance will cover a pill that is very expensive .I'm torn, ripped apart, HATE to hear when anyone is diagnosed with this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Lost my Dad to cancer.....his advice, and I would pass it on to anyone else - don't do the radiation treatment. It does nothing but makes your remaining days that much more unpleasant."
"Fuck cancer-keeping you in thoughts and prayers. You always seemed like such a bad ass, continue fighting and kick its ass!!"
"All the best to Shannen. I know what she's going through...my Mother passed of breast cancer. My prayers are with her. Blessed be my dear  )o("
"If the U.S.A. stops with all the radiation emitting by nuclear plants, weapons testing and more we will have less cancer...in the time of the Egyptians there was no cancer..we created it... Plant more oxygen producing trees and plants anywhere you can to help clean the earth from what we have done to it..we will live longer with less ailments..."
"Please check out PROTON therapy it works on most types of cancer is it just shared my tumor I am also an actor and it works no pain no side effects and no poison I had to go to Oklahoma City for four months but there is one in Loma Linda"
"Um, she kept the tumor in her body for a year and 4 months AFTER diagnosis while she ""decided on which surgery to have"" so yeah, not surprising it's in the lymph nodes.  

My breast cancer was removed within two weeks from the initial testing and began treatment.  Early detection saves lives.  Hate to say it, but if she dies, it's her fault for waiting while she decided what to do to keep her breasts."
"Praying for Shannon and all breast cancer warriors. My mother is a breast cancer survivor."
"I'm really sorry hear your cancer has spread. My aunt is going thru breast cancer as well"
"Well, yeah, the lymph is the system that has to be pumped by excercise and can only be cleaned with herbs and a fresh food diet. Doctors don't know that."
"Prayers of healing. I sm a breast cancer survivor. Be strong!!<ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+00BC><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B9><U+008F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BB>"
"I had 21 lymph nodes removed and was stage III, I'm still here..8 years cancer free..I also did it without chemo,"
"do movie stars, new anchors, etc... have higher rates of cancer, including blood and bone marrow cancers? Is this an occupational hazard?"
"It's a tough road,but keep the faith God Bless. I myself have had breast cancer  and chemo so just stay strong"
"My prayers are for you, Shannen, as well as your family and caregivers. I pray for comfort, strength, and wisdom.  I am sorry your cancer has come back. I will keep my prayers going and follow your journey to health."
"You hang in there. I had breast cancer 2 years ago and mine was in one lymph node . so take care"
"She is just one year younger then I am and this bothers me alot. I hope and pray she can beat this cancer prayers and thoughts are with her family at this time."
"Cancer sucks...my family is goin on 3 years :( prayers to our fighters"
"God bless, I have breast cancer also, no fun!"
"Keep smiling Shannen You will make it thru Chemo and Radiation MY WIFE DID ."
"This is so sad. Just in July alone, I lost two very dear people to cancer. Cancer is an asshole."
"My 19 year old daughter was just diagnosed with breast cancer i am so scared for her :("
"Seems like some commenters don't understand the huge prognostic significance of when cancer cells are found in lymph nodes."
"Dammed cancer can get anyone.. They need to figure this out as it seems breast cancer is common now adays"
"Rooting for you; wishing you success in your treatments. Be well! I'm a breast cancer survivor, too."
"My mom is a 2x breast cancer survivor. She chose to have one breast removed the 2nd time around. Her feeling at 60+ was...I don't need the dam things anymore so lop them both off if you have to!! Her positive outlook was amazing! She was more worried for her grown, adult kids than she was for herself. Like others have stated...keep the positive attitude going strong even though some days you may just want to hide under the blankets and not come out of your room! My mom was out of bed and sitting in a hospital chair before I decided to sober up and go and visit her and eat her yucky hospital food and have a nap in her bed :)"
"its really sad too see somebody,  thats so well recieved by all , struggle with life and all its crappy curveballs, i hope she walks out the other side owning it and saying F you, it's a  battle but you can and will win the war with everyone,s support and good vibes.; im not religious by any means whatsoever , but GOD BLESS i hope it all works out and everyone involved can find some peace and understanding in the journey,"
"I just lost my mom to this, stage 4 bone, breast, and liver which we just found out right before hand. The gene is in my family I have to be careful and get checked out this is very sad for her to go through this but she is helping millions of others."
"Cancer SUCKS! And unless you've gone through it, you don't really understand the fear. I knew I would lose my hair, so I went and had it shaved off, so I wouldn't go through what Shannen did. I read it was a control thing. ONE thing I could control in the midst of things I couldn't control. Learning to accept that your hair or any other part of your body does NOT define who we are! I am still ME, without a uterus! Praying for a good outcome."
"God Bless and keep you, so sorry.  I was just watching the HGTV of you buying your house.  It is never easy, but keep fighting.  You can do this.    I get so angry that with all the money given they can't find a cure for this scourge.  Hugs and prayers."
"I'm truly saddened to hear this news. Shannen doherty is a stellar actress and has tremendous character. I pray that the treatments will do their job and rid her body of the Cancer. I know actress/advocate Mariel Hemingway is a firm believer in Juicing. to work(holistically) in tandem with the traditional(medical) form of treatment. Shannen has always been a favorite of mine as she is a true artist. my daughter gave me for Christmas he book, ""BADASS""  her creativity and ever Unquenchable thirst for knowledge is so apparent in that book. Love you, Shannen!"
"You know no matter how crazy we can get at times in our lives nobody deserves to go through the agony of the unknown like she is right now. I've never been a fan personally but she is a human being with fears and pain like the rest of us. She has loved ones that are scared for her and Im sure she is scared herself too. Good luck in your fight Shannon, I will pray for you and your family :hug:"
"I was just diagnosed with a thyroid disease that has now taken my job (that I lost today). I fear for my future as well. Something about Shannen's story is helping keep me strong ... if she can fight this, I can fight my disease too."
"Diagnosed with AML in march. Just finished last bag of chemo. Hopefully bone marrow biopsy will come out clean.  It's so easy to crawl into a hole and give up. Stay strong. Stay positive. Prayers and family and friends are a powerful healer. I  am a leukemia survivor, proud of my bald head, proud of my battles. Stay strong!"
"Just went through what you are going through now (Sept 2014 to present). Had the surgeries, the chemo and the radiation. It was rough but, you can make it. Do not fear what you cannot control. Just concentrate, one day at a time, on what that day brings! Peace & blessings to you!"
"Hey hun,I'm so very sorry you have to go thru this.I had cervical cancer back in 1989 and the dr.did a vaginal partial hysterectomy.So I understand but I know we do not know each other,but I know you are a strong willed woman stay positive,have faith and everything will be fine.ok I'm sending my love & my concern,& to let you know I'm here for you ok hun luv bh"
"I'm a year ahead of you in what you are feeling. May I suggest to you fight the abyss that we can so easily fall into of worrying about the unknown. I've learned to appreciate each moment and realize there are many before me who have gone on to live very fullfilling lives. Nancy Reagan to name one who lived into her 90's and she had been dagnosed during her first lady years as her husband was Govenor of California! Sudh an inspiration and there are so many more. Trust your medical team and take it one moment at a time. Praying for you!"
"I felt so sorry for Ms. Doherty when she said the press said she looks worn and haggard, not knowing she was so ill.  She came forward and told her story with the hopes of helping at least one person.  You are in my prayers."
"I am also breast cancer survivor, just keep on praying & be strong Shannen...God bless u..."
"Shannen I am not one to comment on things and I don't  know anyone going through breastfeeding cancer but your story moved me! I am so sorry for what your going through  keep the fit and I am praying for you and stay postive you will see this through! God bless"
"She is in my prayers. Don't know her but of course memories of 90210 are always there. These public figures don't know us but it does not matter. What they do is for the public and a piece of them leaves their own person and becomes a part of us."
"Ooh my God!!

"I can't even imagine the pain and horror of this. I have no idea. Maybe someday i'll get cancer, who knows. It's so random and it is such a horrible thing. I am so sorry to anybody who is suffering or the suffering of a loved one close to you."
"I known it's easy to ask you to stay strong, but positive attitude is  the key. I was given 2 months by 2 doctors and met a 3rd and have been cancer free for 26 years. You will be in my prayers"
"I agree Laura about staying strong and being positive. But the best thing would be if you also put you faith in God! I loved you in the tv series. I will put you in a prayer group which dedicates themselves to praying continuously for people in need. God bless you always."

Never give up, keep fighting, look for support, live everyday to the fullest, and love, love, love yourself and every person in your life. Peace!"
"I do not know you personally but only your talent. You have brought many hours of joy and entertainment to your fans and public. Stay strong girl. You can do this. I want to see you well and healthy in a movie or show down the line. God Bless / Get Well"
"U must have Faith as the size of a mustard seed,family support is very important,I was diagnosed with cervical cancer last yr,but God gt me through it and so do u,,this is just a test in yr life,so hold on,God have created us,Woman to be strong,and Gpd love u"

"Shannen, I am praying so hard for you. My mom went through the same thing and it spread to some of her lymph nodes. She went through some tough times, but in the long run, she ended up fine. I pray that you overcome this. I mean this, I don't live too far and I am in the medical field. If you need anything- someone to rum your errands or whatever, please let me know. I worked in the ER at Cedars Sinai for many years, so if you need any kind of help, please- I will help. Just giving back from What my mom went through too! God Bless!"

"Dr Simoncini , they discredit him , but I know personal cases were he has helped breast cancer without chemo or radiation. Chemo causes the cancer cells to spread. The medical industry  makes a fortune off of chemo. There is a cure ,(but they will never release it because they would rather make all the money coming in)The radiation is what kills the cancer .."

"Prayers from one breast cancer survivor to beautiful soul .whom I will pray for."
"I was diagnosed with Triple Negative Invasive Ductal Carcinoma 2 mos ago. I'm 45... IDC is the most common form of breast cancer... The Triple Negative is the most aggressive form of it... They put me at a stage 2 because they found mine had also gone to the lymph node, but only one is affected as of now. Standard protocol is: chemo, surgery and radiation unless you have a bilateral mastectomy. You do, that removes the radiation (sometimes), and lowers your recurrence rate... As long as she fights it and goes through with her treatments she'll make it. Glad she's speaking out about this! 

Get mammograms... Get checked... The life you save could be your own!!!

"I'm going thru this right now. She needs to calm down. Dunno why they removed it first. I had inflammatory breast cancer the worst one. Chemo was done first to shrink the cancer which was also in my lymph nodes. They removed breast and nodes. When the tests from what they removed came back the chemo had killed all the cancer. But I am now doing radiation to kill anything that possibly could still be in my body. Hair is coming back now and I am doing good. I never got sick or couldnt eat or took any pain killers. Its mind over matter. I know it could come back but I don't dwell on that. Think positive. I'm gonna kick cancers ass. Sitting around crying about it just makes you weak. Get mad at it and fight. Its just hair it will come back."
"Stop getting radiation poison in you body, boost your alkaline level, use cannabis oil. Cancer isn't a death sentence."
"Get her to a state in the usa where she can access cannabis oil seriously. Chemotherapy will not help her it will only help the cancer spread."

God manifested Himself on this planet two thousand years ago as Jesus Christ; many things have been said about His advent. His detractors even went so far as to say that He performed His miracles by the power of beelzibub. . . but they ever denied that HE DID THEM. . . . . Cry out to Jesus dear; perhaps He has seen fit in His Sovereign Will to lift you up as a vessel for His great Love and mercy. I know He did so for me."

"Breast cancer is a horrible thing for a woman to face.  I was diagnosed in 2010 - had surgery, radiation and chemo, but in today's world of medicine - it's not a death sentence if caught early, which mine was.  I can tell you a positive attitude, support of friends, family and having faith in The Lord will get anyone thru this trial.  Best wishes and prayers for a speedy recovery."

"Breast cancer is ugly .The one thus far that seems to be nonresponsive  and almost but not always incureable is Triple negative breast cancer . It is three percent of the population and normally runs in forty year old black men but it also runs in the white ethinticy .... Keep positive and continue to pray for Shannon Doherty her fight is to live and which ever kind of breast cancer she has she will over come .."
"For those who want to know and would like to give it a try:  cancer can be cured by cannabis which is also available in a concentrated solution.  I have known 4th stage cancer patients who have been cured by cannabis.  Also eat the almonds that come out of apricot stones -- there are cures that the multi-million dollar cancer industry would like to push under the carpet. Most people who die of cancer, die of chemo and radiation! Cannabis also kills cancer cells like chemo -- but it kills only the bad cells!  Works!"
"I was diagnosed almost 11 years ago with very aggressive stage III breast cancer.  After 8 rounds of chemo, 7 weeks of radiation, 13 months of maintenance drugs and a total of 11 surgeries I'm still here and happy to have just celebrated the BIG 60!  I had cancer, cancer didn't have me!  It wasn't a death sentence for me it was a call to raise awareness to end all cancers."
"I am a breast cancer survivor since 1998.  I have had a mastectomy.  Now  I have to go in for a needle biopsy on my other breast.  Shannen you are in my prayers....."
"As a breast cancer survivor, keep you faith and spirit up.  Let your support system in.  They may not know exactly what you are going through, but they will be there. Remember FIGHT LIKE A GIRL"
"This is really sad.  Also, why aren't more cancer patients told about using dry ice treatments on their scalp so they do not lose their hair?  It's so traumatic to lose your hair and look sick...this can be be avoided.  I hope she makes a full recovery."
"Lots of Prayers for your Shannen...   Hang in there...  Stay Positive and Fight this Horrible Cancer...  You can do it...  God Bless...  <3"
"Stay positive.  I had breast cancer twice in the same breast.  (they didn't take it the first time and 12 years later, had it again in a different area). Now 6 years cancer free.  You can do this.  My sister gave me a present, a small enameled box.  She said open it when you must then put your troubling thoughts back in it and close the lid.  You have a large sisterhood out here. Stay positive and strong - don't worry about the future, embrace every day and make it count."
"I know you probably hear crap like this all the time, my sister,Margaret, was just diagnosed with lung cancer in her left lung, It has grown  from a 3cm to 5cm to 7cm with our last visit  it is now 5""' yes I say 5 inches.  The cancer has grown so fast, it is now in her ribs.  The Doctors have said she has a mass her stomach  and a 1 inch tumor in her brain.  She just under went a triple bypass lin June of 2014.  She has stints placed in both legs within the last 6 months.  I want her to have some hope, but right down its very hard to find, God be with you n your journey."
"Laura.  Sort for asking u.  Shannon's cancer spread into her lymph nodes.  What does thT actually mean ? Less hope.  I hope the opposite."
"It mastisized in me. The dirty bastard!  Spred to liver, wrapped around my tail bone and in my right lung.  All chemo and radiation has failed.  Was sent he to get my affairs in order and spend time with family and loved ones.  The pain can be unbearable.  But with the advancents  in pain  medications id rather be going thru this shit NOW then say 30-50 yrs ago.  My know when the time comes my Late Husband and Jesus will come get me for that HUGE party upstairs.  I know that there is a cure out there. I truely believe we already have it. They keep it a huge secret because there isnt any money in healthy ppl.  Amd they use it as population control.  Just my opinion. I wish nothing but the best for Shannon.  Cancer sucks huge ones."
"I am a breast cancer for 3 years ...it always lurks in back of my mind do I have cancer in another place in my body  that I do not know about yet?  the unknown is  truly the scary part  I was so blessed to know it was not in lymph nodes and radiation was what I needed. Keep positive attitude  I know easier said then done"
"Shannon. Had HER2 stage 3,  5 lymph nodes positive, had lumpectomy, 23 nodes taken out, chemo and radio. I'm 4 years cancer free, fingers crossed. One step after the other. The worry, that will never go completely away, but it's manageable. Much love."
"You are so right,not knowing is the worst.I had my lymph nodes removed, July 11.The depression I am experiencing is overwhelming. No one talks about it.I can't stop crying,can't get out of my bed.God is  all I have and he will see me through,until then I do the best I can. Trying  to stay positive."

"Well done ladies.  It`s important to be positive, even when the unknown is scary.  I have had two scares in 6 months with my other female departments and bleeding from the urethra also fast tracked.  The doctors could not ID the problem, but it`s not the C word thankfully.  We all have to find our own way of exiting the fear, but being loved and supported means so much.  For all of you my love, hugs and support.  XXX"

"Sweetie, as my mom would say, "" I have a good feeling about this"". She was always  right. First year, L was diagnosed with breast cancer, next year my middle sister got it. Third year my baby sister got it. All of us lost our body hair and now 22 years later have to get our hair thinned when it grows back so thick. You were smart to shave your head before your friends had to come after you picking up your hair...LOL. A good sense of humor got me through it and my two sisiers knew they would be okay cuz they saw how I was doing.. Be assured that you have a whole sisterhood praying for you."

"Shannon I am 56 years old and this is the third time I have been diagnosed with breast cancer and I don't even have any breast left. I absolutely believe the story about your dog because my dogs out and did exactly the same thing before I was diagnosed a very docile Mastiff started to sit in front of me and bark excessively this is a dog that never even barked at the mailman and then one day he jumped up and took a little nip on my right breast. Needless to say he knew that I had cancer for the second time before I knew it. Unfortunately he also got cancer we were sick together he succumb to the disease and I am still here I miss him every day. He was a French Mastiff a Bordeaux. Good Vibes and lots of prayers coming your way."

Here I am 12 years later, cancer free with a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The time you will go through with chemo, hair loss, all the sickness and pain is short-lived. once you get past that you will live again and you will enjoy life. I firmly believe a positive take no prisoners attitude is what got me through and I pray for you and hope that you will find strength in the massive amount of women and families who have been touched by cancer and have not let it define them. Cancer is just something I went through and is a part of my life, but it's not who I am. God bless"

"My guinea pig who is pretty aloof compared to dogs and cats always came out of her igloo hiding when I was/am at my lowest lows. She's not fond of being picked up/petted much but she would give me a break when she sensed it. Pets are the best. Everyone needing unconditional love that's not getting it elsewhere especially should have such pets to help get through the darkness."

"I suggest she try Carnivora and consider this cancer to be an extreme immune system challenge, using Carnivora according to the instructions for an extreme immune system challenge. http://www.supplementdirect.com/carnivoraresearchintlcarnivora100capvegi.aspx  I don't sell it, but my mother and I have used it for nearly two and one-half years.  It really does strengthen the immune system, diminish the duration of colds and prevents infections from setting in.  Animal studies are now almost complete. Its active ingredient is considered a Chemotherapy drug in Germany."

"Simulation of REM Sleep :- Exercise can refresh/detox muscle cells instantly. But it can't do the same thing for brain cells (plus many internal organs including skin and bone) until you stop moving. Once you stop, your heart rate starts dropping but your blood may still have a few tens of seconds to refresh/detox your brain cells, only if these rules are met : elevated heart rate, no body movements, empty stomach, and no stress hormones. If you compare these rules with REM sleep<U+2019>s, they are identical. So far, the most ingenious way to simulate REM sleep is to slow down your taichi movements markedly until your brain thinks that you are not moving. Then, the effect of a 30 minute session would equate to 30 minutes of blood perfusion or 7 hours of sleep. This taichi microcirculation method was once used in China around 1900. Unfortunately, people made taichi faster in 1956 because they didn't understand this heart rate stimulation therapy theory. They also didn't know that they can get around this  <U+201C>too fast<U+201D> problem by doing 30 sets of modern taichi in 1 day, which is exactly like playing a 9-hole golf game, or walking (and stopping) 30 times a day. These start-stop methods are time consuming, but they are still very effective.

All food stimulants, muscle stretching, acupuncture, cupping, etc. are short term fixes. They can work well initially if you follow the same rules. However, the effect can disappear in a few weeks time when you get used to it, and you must be smart enough to rotate stimulants. 

Most folks in big cities have this brain malnutrition problem because of insufficient sleep, constant stress, contaminations, and bad lifestyles. The problems would trickle down to downstream organs and form chronic diseases  in a few years time, or even cancers at a later stage. Caution: If you can<U+2019>t stop these bad habits, not even taichi can save you.

"Clear since 1988!!!!"
"17 years for me."
"Yup. My mom had a dream a few months ago that someone dropped me off on her doorstep as I was vomitting/dying. She has no clue that I have cancer nor does anyone in my family either side. They all live far so easy to keep secret. Imagine my surprise when she emailed me asking me if if I'm really ok. Not only that but around the same time 2 aunts on my dad's side of the family had the same sense about me and asked my dad if I'm really ok. Very weird."

"Thanks for sharing this. PCOS has so many awful side affects. I don't suffer from hair loss bc of it like this poor woman but major fertility issues plagued us. We finally had a baby two years ago after three miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy, three rounds of IVF and $50,000. The disorder makes your body go through hell. Kudos to this woman for handling it so well and coming to terms with it."

"A friend told my mother that it hurts like hell so my mom refused to get one. By the time they found her breast cancer it was widely spread. A few minutes of discomfort are definitely better than the alternative."
"Ya know what's scarier.... Cancer treatment.  Without mammograms some of us wouldn't be here today."
"I never had this response. Mine was ""OK,  now we deal with it"" lumpectomy, breast reduction, 3 months of chemo, hair loss, 6weeks of radiation. Done! 5 years later I'm thankful for the drugs that diminish my bones, because now, there's Prolia, a shot every 6 months and, my 5 year drug is now recommended for 10 years, OK lets do that then. I am so very sorry for anyone that has to go through this but please, stay positive,  because that's the easiest way to get through it."
"i m the only one having cancer in the family, among other serious problems; i dont  handle it, i let life flow and hope to be around some more years, that s all. by the way, hormonoterapy does not    always hit your bones or gives hot flashes...i had none of them, although i have severe fatigue for instance and i ll go for 5 years more hormonotherapy instead of 5 as it seems it keeps us alive longuer. i really dont handle anything...i let it flow, as many things in life..and no, i haven t done anything wrong to have it either..shit happens, you know..i had much worse than this cancer with my twins extreme prematurity..it ends up to be a piece of cake, even if for sure will kill me sooner or later..let it flow..."
"What did I Do Wrong? I keep asking this. I had breast cancer 25 years ago, since then I have been a bit of a health nut doing what my doctors said and more. I was diagnosed again with a different breast cancer this year. I'm rediculously healthy per my doctors so how? How Can I have this again? What do I tell my daughters on how to protect themselves? There are no answers it seems. finding a cure is good but could we find the cause please, so no other person has to deal with the horrors   of surgery and treatment.  I'm almost at the end of the rough chemo and still have other treatments to go through."
"This really hits home.  I felt like the floor opened up and was engulfing me.  Your plans, your future is now gone, out of your hands.  It's all up in smoke.  All of your dreams, gone, because your fate is not in your hands.  Will it come back?  Where?  Will I be here for my special needs adult son, will I see my grandchildren grow up?  
After a bilateral mastectomy, and seven years from that day, the same questions are always on my mind.  The fear never goes away...never."

"I'm 44 years old.  I've lived with MS since I was 27 years old. Then at 40 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, Stage III, Grade III, T2.  Bad thing about the cancer is, I can never take my MS medication ever again, Rebif shots, as it stimulates cancer cells.  I was told basically to choose - either let MS kill me or let cancer kill me.  I chose to live with MS and fight to keep my cancer away!  My husband has MS as well.  He was diagnosed at age of 19, BEFORE we met.  Took 5 five years after our marriage to find out I had MS.  I was told to stop having children.  As after our second child was born, my symptoms came out RAGING.  Couldn't walk, went blind, numbness and tingling...  If we were to have more children, the stress would be too much on my body.  So we stopped having children.  Thank god I had my daughter and then my son. After that we were done.  Now my children have a higher percentage of developing MS.  It's not suppose to be genetic, but who knows?  I thouight having MS was a death sentence.  That is, until I started treating with my medication and it was helping.  Then I was told I had CANCER. That was more of a death sentence to me.  I just hope and pray to god that I stay healthy and that neither disease takes my life!"

"I love pink and usually buy a few pink ribbon things that I have happily used the last four years as a survivor. I don't donate to Komen but I do donate to another organization that was a big support to me during my journey.
Believe it or not, when I wear my survivor pin during the month of October or scarf or whatever, I have had people come up and ask me questions. Maybe they were afraid to go get that first mammogram or what have you but meeting a survivor usually sparks a discussion and it has been amazing to meet people who have survived for 30 years. It's just a really happy month for me because I had my surgery in October and now I'm past all of it and I'm just so proud to still be here and healthy. But I understand that many organizations don't donate the money for research.  Awareness is important for sure. Congrats to all of us and I pray we all have many more healthy years."
"I'm a 11 year survivor and I love all the pink stuff.  I use it for breast cancer awareness events all of the time and for my personal use.   I know buying it doesn't go for much of anything, it is just a way to make things nice for the guests at our events."

"Good for them. However I honestly don't feel like they have any clue what most women go through with illness. They don't worry about copays and deductibles. They don't worry about losing their job or their home. They don't worry about paying for meds or putting food on the table. They have the finances to get the treatment they need. They have the support of family and friends and the media. I'm happy these stars have survived but I guarantee they have never once felt as I have."

"Yes, I lost my mother and my grandmother. You are so right about your mother and we share at least this about what we miss so dearly:1.	Her laugh:  She had a great sense of humor; but she did not like my jokes, or my Dad<U+2019>s jokes!
2.	Her sense of fun: My mom knew how to have a good time, I have seen the films and the photos, but she never allowed herself the time when raising five children. 
3.	Her yoga/swimming: My mom was a staunch believer in academics over athletics. I have spent years learning to be athletic on my own!
4.	Her sense of style: My mom had a good sense of fashion until she became too weary from raising five children. I look at old photos and I wish I knew her when she was dressing Chanel/Jackie O style without spending the money on designer labels.
5.	Her reassurance: My mom could be a tough-as-nails hard-ass when she wanted to be, but she was also a therapist and always knew the right way to tell me how to manage friend drama and dating troubles. I know she would have been the most helpful with my son when I had trouble, she died when my son was two years old.
6.	Her way with kids: It's so painful to me that my mom will never know my son. She would have adored him and he would have adored her, too. 
7.	Her hands: They were evidence of how hard she was always working, and she even tirelessly gardened without wearing gloves.
8.	Her music: My mom was a huge fan of the folk music of the 1960s, and I grew up listening to her Judy Collins albums. The rest of my household was listening to Rock and Roll.
9.	Her help: I can't even count the number of times I had no one to help me except my sisters after my son was born. All my friends had moms. 
10.	Her driving: My mom was the only person I knew who was a worse driver than me. I totally miss her being here to make me look good! Actually, I am no longer a bad driver, but I was when she was alive.
11.	Her sense of history: When did I walk? Was I always so talkative? Was I picky about fashion? My Dad did not recall these moments in detail, he was always working. But he is also gone (prostate cancer). 
12.	Her family: Some families are made stronger by losses. My sisters and I have to work hard to stay in the loop with her wonderful family."

"I lost a very dear friend to breast cancer yesterday. She leaves behind two boys who are only 13 and 11 years old and only child of her parents. Those of you who never had a mammogram, do get one because it could save your life! I am convinced to get one too and it'll be the first time and I'm in my 40's. I am doing it for my daughter.

"Shannen was really annoying when she was on TV. That being said, I am admiring her now for her bravery and determination to beat her cancer. I've lost friends to this disease and I feel for anyone who has to go through this. Shannen, I hope you can kick this in the ass and annoy me again in the future."

But this story speaks volumes to this woman's strength and drive. I could care less that she is famous but I do wish her a fast recovery and a speedy return to health. She is a human like the rest of us and I wish her well. Stay strong miss Doherty, may your strength inspire others who are suffering."
"It's great she can go to the gym. Personally I used the day after chemo 'high' to clean the house and do the laundry. The drugs given during chemo treatments such as steroids produce a temporary sense of wellness that unfortunately is very short lived.  Just saying...."
"Wow. This is so inspirational.  I normally cannot stand celebs...but when I see them like this, as an actual human, it makes them a role model."

"I went numb, like my whole world stopped and it felt like a bad dream, then I just cried for hours. I was already dealing with my dad having lung cancer and now me, how do I tell my kids, my family, my friends. How can this be happening, why me, what did I do to deserve it? I don't want to die I want to live. I was so angry with the world, with everything, so many emotions. I spent my first night trying to get my head around the fact I had breast cancer, something you never think will happen to you.

"Mammograms never found my 2 cancer sites.....My Doctor found the first one during a Physical Exam and sent me for diagnostics.....It was the Ultra Sound done after the Mammogram that confirmed what the Doctor had felt. (followed by Biopsy, Surgery, Chemo and Radiation).....A Mammogram a year later revealed no findings on/in the remaining breast (only one was removed as Medicare would not cover having both removed UNLESS cancer was identified in both)...At the next Mammogram, nothing was found but a week or so later I found a lump and went back in to the Diagnostic Center.....I had found it while standing and applying lotion after bathing.  Another Mammogram was done followed by an Ultra Sound.  The Ultra Sound Tech could not find what I had found while I was reclined on the table.....I sat up.  She said she could not do an Ultra Sound with me sitting up.  I said....I cannot show you unless I am vertical...I cannot find it when lying on my bed....Gravity works for more than just Newton and the Apple.  She let me show her where it was and then could find it with me reclining.....This was followed by Biopsy, Surgery and Radiation and I was started on Anastrozole.  Pathology report of tissue removed was 4 pages long.  I had All 4  Kinds of  Breast Cancer having a party in there......Very likely some of that was already started when I had my first Mastectomy......Mid November of this year marks 4 years of that first day of You Have Cancer........It has been quite a Journey....SURVIVORSHIP starts when you First Have Knowledge of having CANCER.......something many do not realize.....You Survive the Learning, the Surgery, the Chemo, the Radiation and everything else that comes along....all cases are different..........................A Survivor"

21 mins <U+00B7> 
So, as some of you know, OCTOBER is 'Breast Cancer Awareness Month.' But what does that really mean? I mean, what are you supposed to be aware of? That Breast Cancer is the second leading cause of death among women? And that some committee somewhere got together and said, ""Hey, let's have a Breast Cancer Awareness month...."" and it was done? And someone else posted a few announcements on Facebook or Twitter or maybe bought an ad in some local newspaper or put on a pink wristband or a pink ribbon on their lapel or dress or.... SO WHY DO THAT? Here's why: Because as you go about your day, you're probably encountering no fewer than four people per day who know someone who is battling or has succumbed to or has survived BREAST CANCER. Say what? Four people a day? Then if it's that many, why wouldn't we already be aware of Breast Cancer? Why would we need to set aside A MONTH just to recognize it? Think about it: it's ALL AROUND YOU. Well, therein lies perhaps CANCER's MOST POWERFUL WEAPON. It's like the Devil roaming about like a lion looking for His next victim. Almost everyone knows someone who has been been bitten by that lion but no one wants to talk about it. Why? Probably because it's scary. Probably because it seems like one of those inevitabilities that we're powerless over, that maybe it will go away if we ignore it, that it's no way to entertain a compelling or harmless conversation because, well, it's CANCER and, really, who wants to talk about CANCER? I'll tell you who: your mothers, your sisters, your office colleagues, your friends, that woman who serves you muffins at the bakery; that banker who processes your checks; that bus driver who gets you across town; that attorney who is trying to get the best deal for her client; that husband whose wife just heard the words 'Stage 3' and he wonders why something so dangerous gets a number that their four-year-old son can count up to on one hand; that high school teacher who looks out over a sea of students and, because she's fought it herself, wonders how to share between equations, the 'calculus' of survival and how many of her students will become cancer's statistic; the firefighter who scales ladders of three-story buildings to break glass and pull out a terrified senior citizen, yet can't seem to step above the despair that his mother might not be around this time next Wednesday; that fine artist who turns to watercolors and parchment in an effort through fields of flowers and butterflies or roaring oceans and violent storms tries to make sense of it all; that EVERYONE who has been or will be TOUCHED BY BREAST CANCER. That everyone who is AWARE and somehow needs everyone else to be AWARE. Because if we don't make each of us aware, then CANCER WINS. But if we stand on a mountain top and yell, or simply entertain a one-to-one water cooler discussion that carry's the echo of a yell that is stronger and longer than the scream from atop a snowy peak, then CANCER LOSES. Because cancer hates to be exposed. Look how dedicated tumors are to masking themselves so that our bodies don't see them. Silent killer? There's none better trained, no finer master of the profession. Cancer hates the spotlight. Absolutely hates it. But when we talk about it, demystify it, pay attention to the man behind the curtain, then we are as powerful over cancer as the oncologist who detects it, confirms it, then zaps it or chemically bombards it or cuts it out or who uses the body's own genetics to turn on it and say: ""Hey, you're the invader! You gotta go!"" And that's why you should go and tell someone about Breast Cancer. Today. And every day, not just during BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH. Because we have to win. And to win, we need to identify the enemy and keep exposing the enemy until the enemy gives up and goes away never to return. Someday, there will be no BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH. Why? Because we won't need one. We'll reserve October for raking leaves in all their brilliance, we'll reserve it for little kids in masks giggling from door to door, and for hot mugs of cocoa warming our noses from the bleachers of the local high school football game, and for everything that promotes LOVE and LIFE. -- Dawn M.

"To each is own. That choice was what felt right for her. Not everyone is the same.  I opted for reconstruction despite the complications. I have had 3 surgeries in less than 2 years. I'm now healing from the latest surgery 3 weeks ago. it's just a matter of patience, faith and following doctor's orders."
"2 month's ago.only I had breast reconstruction with implant. Only one breath cos NHS can't do both.so I look ridiculous with 2 different breast.after long journey fighting with cancer"

"I have known for years that I have dense breast tissue. My mother and her sister and her daughter have all had breast cancer and my dad and brother passed away from cancer so I do whatever it takes to screen for cancers. My OBGYN has told me to always do 3D mammograms (which I have to pay $50 out of pocket that insurance doesn't pay) and now I've been told I should also have an ultrasound (and I have to pay out of pocket completely) as my insurance deductible is so high I never reach it in a year. I gladly pay it as I have watched my brother pass away from cancer because the right test wasn't done to catch it early enough. Don't take chances on your own health!! No matter if it cost extra!! Does your life have a price??!!"
"I went to have a ultrasound done this past Monday and found out that I had dense breast.  Nothing serious but will always do what I need to do and take care of myself just to make sure everything is alright for now and the next 4 to 5 years and so on."

"It's a very difficult to digest. I was glad I had my mother with me when I got my diagnosed in November 2014. I broke down crying and she did too, but we calmed down and asked what where the n wed xt steps. It was  such a chaotic time with visits to oncologists, breast surgeons,  more biopsies & sonograms being done, MRIs, surgeries, chemo. I just had surgery 3 weeks ago and I'm recovering slowly, but surely. It's been a roller coaster. Thank God my faith in God, my doctors and my family and friends support has helped me pull through."

"My wife went through a very similar situation at the Minneapolis airport. Prior to her going through I explained the situation to the TSA agent, since my wife was embarrassed. Once through the body scanning machine the lady would not take her to a private room and insisted on a firm pat down. I had already explained the drain tubes and suction balls. They were very aggressive to the point of my wife breaking down crying. Definitely not the way to start a vacation. 
I understand they have a job, but we tryed to be up front, so it was no big deal. Definitely not much training for this type of situation."
"Wow, unfortunately I see this behavior all the time. The way they address people is so unprofessional. I have seen them screaming at people. This is the first interaction with the passengers get when coming into an airport. I completely understand that they have a job to do. We all want to be safe. But everyone deserves respect and true guest service. This is lacking with many TSA agents that I encounter on a daily basis since I work within the airport. We need to do better as a whole.. I am so sorry for her traumatic experience and pray she gets through her treatments and is healed."
"This happened to me on  my way to PA!!! The lady was so rude to me and she practically molested me in front of everyone then took me to a room where they made me take off shirt. It was horrible it was in front of my son and also if she would have let me I could have showed her I had my port card."
"I get patted down every time I fly. I flew right after my surgery several times. If this happened to me at that time I would have been in handcuffs. They would have to restrain and gag me. Luckily for me TSA has been respectful. I just had it happen in Newark. It's intimidating and frightening especially when a woman is in this fragile emotional state. This is disgraceful."
"They were this aggressive with my 80 year old, wheelchair bound aunt. Too much power in the hands of individuals who aren't suited for it."
"I would have gone ballistic if they would have done that to me when I was going through the same thing as her!!! Absolutely not called for."

They get low-income people with no training,and give them the power to abuse the public,and humiliate others.
TSA should be gotten RID OF !!"

"To whom it may concern,

My name is Yun Hu, and I am part of a research team of Duke University School of Nursing. Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN and her colleagues at Duke University are conducting a research study to test the effectiveness of a technology-based information and coaching/support program for Asian American women living with breast cancer. This study is funded by NIH (National Institutes of Health).
Currently, we are in the process of recruiting participants to enroll in the study. We are looking for an Asian American woman aged 21 years and older who has had a breast cancer diagnosis in the past five years; can read and write English, Mandarin Chinese, Korean or Japanese; have access to the Internet; and identify their sub-ethnicity as Chinese, Korean, or Japanese. 
Eligible participants who agree to join the study will be randomly assigned to two groups. Depending on the group that you are randomly assigned, you may or may not be asked to use the technology-based program. You will ask to 1) use the educational information (the American Cancer Society breast cancer survivorship website that is provided by the research team), or 2) participate the online forum and 1:1 coaching/support program. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire for three times. Your participation will last about 3-months. After the program is finished, each participant will receive $ 50 reimbursement. Please note that your participation is voluntary, and you can withdraw your participation at any time. 
For more information, please visit our Web site (link:___________) and/or contact us by phone(919-660-1600) or e-mail (TICAA@duke.edu). Thank you for your interest.

"Two beautiful ladies! I am a breast cancer survivor and fought so hard against the cancer and 6 years later am still here! I remember the first real time of looking in a full length mirror for the first time. Body full of scars, hair breaking off, very little eyebrows, etc. My main concern was beating this and not concentrating on what I looked like but was a shock. Had great support from my husband and friends during the entire time. Shared my feelings with other women. Normal to feel that way and though I am not a particularly vain person, after some makeup and a funky short hairstyle started feeling better which helped me power through this. May God bless you both. You can see in profile picture that my long red hair has grown back and grew out curly. Thought it was cool."

"Medical cannabis and lungs cancer
THC has been found to reduce tumor growth in common lung cancer by 50 percent and to significantly reduce the ability of the cancer to spread, say researchers at Harvard University, who tested the chemical in both lab and mouse studies. The researchers suggest that THC might be used in a targeted fashion to treat lung cancer. (study)

Although the researchers do not know why THC inhibits tumor growth, they say the substance could be activating molecules that arrest the cell cycle. They speculate that THC may also interfere with angiogenesis and vascularization, which promotes cancer growth.
Cannabis doctors found that smoking marijuana does not appear to increase the risk of lung cancer or head-and-neck malignancies, even among heavy users. The more tobacco a person smoked, the greater their risk of developing lung cancer and other cancers of the head and neck. But people who smoked more marijuana were not at increased risk compared with people who smoked less and people who didn<U+2019>t smoke at all. 
<U+201C>We know that there are as many or more carcinogens and co-carcinogens in marijuana smoke as in cigarettes,<U+201D> researcher Donald Tashkin, MD, of UCLA<U+2019>s David Geffen School of Medicine tells WebMD. <U+201C>But we did not find any evidence for an increase in cancer risk for even heavy marijuana smoking.<U+201D> Carcinogens are substances that cause cancer.
  Marijuana use was associated with cancer risk ratios below 1.0, indicating that a history of pot smoking had no effect on the risk for respiratory cancers. In contrast, tobacco smoking had a 21-fold risk for cancer.  <U+201C>It<U+2019>s possible that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in marijuana smoke may encourage apoptosis, or programmed cell death, causing cells to die off before they have a chance to undergo malignant transformation<U+201D>.
These are good tips to learn from. And a friend request can be sent to me if you wanna know more and how to get good medical cannabis."

"Spot on. With my middle and youngest daughters I was only able to breastfeed them for only about 5-6 weeks before discovering they were allergic to my milk and had to be fed formula, people just don't stop to consider the reasons why someone might not be breastfeeding"
"What's the big flippin' deal? As a working Mom, I breast and bottle fed. My kids were fine, they thrived and are now brilliant and successful adults. So, lighten the hell up, already!!"
"I breast-fed both of my babies and they still got tons of ear infections and still got sick so that is a myth! And there immune system did not get that great of a boost and I breast-fed my first child so she was over-year-old and my second time he was nine months"
"Breast fed four babies .... there were times I wished they would have taken a bottle! LOL!  We shouldn't shame each other... as long as your child(ren) are happy and healthy!  <U+2764>"
"as long as the baby is fed and healthy, who cares how they get their food.  what is wrong with people?   we all need our own life and our own way.  I nursed my kids and two of them have asthma, it's genetic.  How you feed your baby is none of my business."
"So, wait. People get mad at mothers for not breastfeeding, but they also get mad when they breastfeed in public? ... I am one step more tired of humanity."
"I  didn't breast feed mine, even though I was pressured to do so, and they turned out to be healthy, I knew I would be working and formula was the better option"

"If it's not an option, then it's not an option. I breastfeed both my daughters, it was the late 70's early 80's. My Drs didn't agree with it.  It's too hard today, women have to work. There's no way I would go through that and work another job. Don't stress there are very valid reasons for not doing it."
"Love it,you do wot you have to feed your baby.  I was made to feel bad coz he didn't want my milk. But at the healthy age of 11,he is still amazing."
"You get crazy psycho mom's who feel it's fine to attack other mothers because they can't. Instead of minding their own business and worrying about their own kids they feel it's ok to pass judgement on matters they know nothing about."
"Mom's struggle because the information they are told isnt always right. Your told to breastfeed for 20 minutes. But did you know that your milk dont come in till day for and that your babies stomach is the size of a thimble or marble. If we nurse the first day of birth for five miuntes each feeding that will give your baby what it needs with colostrum, next day you feed for 7 minutes then day 3 for ten. By day for your milk comes in. Also alot of moms im one included especially with my first you dont get a good latch and you time your self both bad factors. Plus, its frustrating but your body will make enough milk for each stage of your babies needs. I was never told half of this or the fact when your baby is going through a growth spurt you should nurse constantly that day becuase by the next day you will have produce the right amount of milk for your baby. I am pregnant with twins so i am greatful i have a place that actually has taught me more about breastfeeding and the problems. I had nothing with with my first two kids. Theres a great video on breast feeding that explains and shows how to hold right. She also talks about fore milk and hindmilk. If you dont drain the foremilk you loose the hindmilk which is like whole milk.  We need more information and help especially after coming home with the babies. It is frustrating i went through it with my first, my second was different but still didnt have enough info or help."
"30+ yrs ago I had quantity not quality as bub got older.  So 9/10 months old bottles & rice cereal etc as bub had 4 teeth was the way to go.  Mums do what you want with feeding your bub & don't stress about what others say.  At the end of the day it's you & your bub that matter not P O."
"I was unable to produce at all, I was glared at many times for giving formula to my daughter. I was even called an uncaring mother. 
It's sad that people, even other women are this hurtful to each other."
"Just people are how they are , they always will judge 
More between women's is crazzy my god 
Competition between women's and jealousy ridicules  drama   .
The one doesn't like all that we step away from it 
No judging no jealousy people ."

"This includes a vaccine for Breast Cancer FDA Approves US Trial of Cuban Lung Cancer Vaccine  

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a US clinical trial of a lung cancer vaccine developed in Cuba.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the approval on October 26 at a press conference at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, where the trial will be conducted.

The vaccine, CimaVax, was developed for non<U+2013>small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has been available in Cuba since 2011.

The newly approved study will be phase 1/2 trial of CIMAvax in combination with the anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) in patients previously treated for advanced NSCLC. Roswell Park anticipates that the trial will take 3 years to complete and will enroll 60 to 90 patients.

CimaVax targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in approximately 40% to 80% of NSCLCs. EGFR overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, lower survival, and resistance to therapy in cancer. The vaccine's mechanism of action is to prevent binding of the endogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the receptors, thus denying tumors the growth factor.

The vaccine has been in development for 25 years. Studies have shown it yields a survival advantage in comparison with supportive care. Despite some mainstream news hype about CIMAvax, the benefit seen so far is not considered to be game changing, as previously reported by Medscape Medical News.

To date, CIMAvax has been used to treat about 4000 patients worldwide. It is approved for use in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Cuba, Paraguay, and Peru, according to the Roswell Park Institute website.

In a phase 3 trial, patients with advanced disease who had been vaccinated had a significant improvement in median overall survival in comparison with control patients who received best supportive care (12.4 months vs 9.4 months; weighted log rank, P = 0.04) (Clin Cancer Res. 2016;22:3782-3790). The researchers noted that the median survival (14.6 months) was longer in vaccinated patients who had high EGF concentration at baseline.

A US lung cancer specialist cautions that the expectations about this vaccine should not be overblown.

""It seems to provide a very modest survival benefit,"" said Jack West, MD, of the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle in an online forum held this past summer.

Dr West was commenting on some of the media hype about the vaccine that emerged earlier this year. ""As a rule, you don't need to debate whether something is a breakthrough years after it has been used routinely in another part of the world for many years,"" he said.

According to Roswell Park press materials, CIMAvax may also prove effective in treating colon, head and neck, prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers   http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/871110"
